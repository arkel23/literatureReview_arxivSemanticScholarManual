Vis.,2021.0,13,"Recently proposed methods for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation have achieved impressive performance in predicting pixel classes despite being trained with only image labels which lack positional information. Because image annotations are cheaper and quicker to generate, weak supervision is more practical than full supervision for training segmentation algorithms. These methods have been predominantly developed to solve the background separation and partial segmentation problems presented by natural scene images and it is unclear whether they can be simply transferred to other domains with different characteristics, such as histopathology and satellite images, and still perform well. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods on natural scene, histopathology, and satellite image datasets and analyzes how to determine which method is most suitable for a given dataset. Our experiments indicate that histopathology and satellite images present a different set of problems for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation than natural scene images, such as ambiguous boundaries and class co-occurrence. Methods perform well for datasets they were developed on, but tend to perform poorly on other datasets. We present some practical techniques for these methods on unseen datasets and argue that more work is needed for a generalizable approach to weakly-supervised semantic segmentation.

Because of these differences, neural network architectures that work well for natural images might not be applicable to medical image analysis. In this work, we propose a novel neural network model to address these unique properties of medical images. This model first uses a low-capacity, yet memory-efficient, network on the whole image to identify the most informative regions. It then applies another higher-capacity network to collect details from chosen regions. Finally, it employs a fusion module that aggregates global and local information to make a prediction. While existing methods often require lesion segmentation during training, our model is trained with only image-level labels and can generate pixel-level saliency maps indicating possible malignant findings. We apply the model to screening mammography interpretation: predicting the presence or absence of benign and malignant lesions. On the NYU Breast Cancer Screening Dataset, our model outperforms (AUC = 0.93) ResNet-34 and Faster R-CNN in classifying breasts with malignant findings. On the CBIS-DDSM dataset, our model achieves performance (AUC = 0.858) on par with state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to ResNet-34, our model is 4.1x faster for inference while using 78.4% less GPU memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate, in a reader study, that our model surpasses radiologist-level AUC by a margin of 0.11."

Fully supervised body part segmentation methods achieve good performances but require an enormous amount of effort to annotate part masks for training. In contrast to high annotation costs needed for a limited number of part mask annotations, a large number of weak labels such as poses and full body masks already exist and contain relevant information. Motivated by the possibility of using existing weak labels, we propose the first weakly supervised body part segmentation framework. The core idea is first converting the sparse weak labels such as keypoints to the initial estimate of body part masks, and then iteratively refine the part mask predictions. We name the initial part masks estimated from poses the “part priors”. with sufficient extra weak labels, our weakly supervised framework achieves a comparable performance (62.0% mIoU) to the fully supervised method (63.6% mIoU) on the Pascal-Person-Part dataset. Furthermore, in the extended semi-supervised setting, the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-art methods. Moreover, we extend our proposed framework to other keypoint-supervised part segmentation tasks such as face parsing."

These avatars are driven by pose parameters and have realistic clothing that moves and deforms naturally. SCANimate does not rely on a customized mesh template or surface mesh registration. We observe that fitting a parametric 3D body model, like SMPL, to a clothed human scan is tractable while surface registration of the body topology to the scan is often not, because clothing can deviate significantly from the body shape. We also observe that articulated transformations are invertible, resulting in geometric cycle-consistency in the posed and unposed shapes. These observations lead us to a weakly supervised learning method that aligns scans into a canonical pose by disentangling articulated deformations without templatebased surface registration. Furthermore, to complete missing regions in the aligned scans while modeling posedependent deformations, we introduce a locally pose-aware implicit function that learns to complete and model geometry with learned pose correctives. In contrast to commonly used global pose embeddings, our local pose conditioning significantly reduces long-range spurious correlations and improves generalization to unseen poses, especially when training data is limited. Our method can be applied to poseaware appearance modeling to generate a fully textured avatar. We demonstrate our approach on various clothing ∗Currently at Facebook Reality Labs. types with different amounts of training data, outperforming existing solutions and other variants in terms of fidelity and generality in every setting.

Existing approaches mainly focus on distilling information from high-level features. In this article, by contrast, we show that by integrating low-level information (e.g., color, edge junctions, texture patterns), performance can be improved with enhanced feature representation and accurately located discriminative regions. Our solution, named Attention Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (AP-CNN), consists of 1) a dual pathway hierarchy structure with a top-down feature pathway and a bottom-up attention pathway, hence learning both high-level semantic and low-level detailed feature representation, and 2) an ROI-guided refinement strategy with ROI-guided dropblock and ROI-guided zoom-in operation, which refines features with discriminative local regions enhanced and background noises eliminated. The proposed AP-CNN can be trained end-to-end, without the need of any additional bounding box/part annotation. Extensive experiments on three popularly tested FGVC datasets (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, and FGVC-Aircraft) demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Manual annotation is the current clinical practice, being highly time-consuming and inconsistent on tumor’s longitudinal assessment. Effectively training an automatic segmentation model is desirable but relies heavily on a large number of pixel-wise labelled data. Existing weaklysupervised segmentation approaches often struggle with regions nearby the lesion boundaries. In this paper, we present a novel weakly-supervised universal lesion segmentation method by building an attention enhanced model based on the High-Resolution Network (HRNet), named AHRNet, and propose a regional level set (RLS) loss for optimizing lesion boundary delineation. AHRNet provides advanced high-resolution deep image features by involving a decoder, dual-attention and scale attention mechanisms, which are crucial to performing accurate lesion segmentation. RLS can optimize the model reliably and effectively in a weaklysupervised fashion, forcing the segmentation close to lesion boundary. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the best performance on the publicly large-scale DeepLesion dataset and a hold-out test set."

However, without contrast agents enhancing, the tumor in liver images presents low contrast and even invisible to naked eyes. Thus the liver tumor segmentation from non-enhanced images is quite challenging. We propose a Weakly-Supervised Teacher-Student network (WSTS) to address the liver tumor segmentation in non-enhanced images by leveraging additional box-level-labeled data (labeled with a tumor bounding-box). WSTS deploys a weakly-supervised teacher-student framework (TCH-ST), namely, a Teacher Module learns to detect and segment the tumor in enhanced images during training, which facilitates a Student Module to detect and segment the tumor in non-enhanced images independently during testing. To detect the tumor accurately, the WSTS proposes a Dual-strategy DRL (DDRL), which develops two tumor detection strategies by creatively introducing a relative-entropy bias in the DRL. To accurately predict a tumor mask for the box-level-labeled enhanced image and thus improve tumor segmentation in non-enhanced images, the WSTS proposes an Uncertainty-Sifting Self-Ensembling (USSE). The USSE exploits the weakly-labeled data with self-ensembling and evaluates the prediction reliability with a newly-designed Multi-scale Uncertainty-estimation. WSTS is validated with a 2D MRI dataset, where the experiment achieves 83.11% of Dice and 85.12% of Recall in 50 patient testing data after training by 200 patient data (half amount data is box-level-labeled). Such a great result illustrates the competence of WSTS to segment the liver tumor from non-enhanced images. Thus, WSTS has excellent potential to assist radiologists by liver tumor segmentation without contrast-agents."

However, most of existing methods cannot model the fine-grained video-text local correspondences well and do not have effective supervision information for correspondence learning, thus yielding unsatisfying performance. To address the above issues, we propose an end-to-end Local Correspondence Network (LCNet) for weakly supervised temporal sentence grounding. The proposed LCNet enjoys several merits. First, we represent video and text features in a hierarchical manner to model the fine-grained video-text correspondences. Second, we design a self-supervised cycle-consistent loss as a learning guidance for video and text matching. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to fully explore the fine-grained correspondences between video and text for temporal sentence grounding by using self-supervised learning. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed LCNet significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised methods."

Due to the lack of frame-level annotations during training, current WS-TAL methods rely on attention mechanisms to localize the foreground snippets or frames that contribute to the video-level classification task. This strategy frequently confuse context with the actual action, in the localization result. Separating action and context is a core problem for precise WS-TAL, but it is very challenging and has been largely ignored in the literature. In this paper, we introduce an Action-Context Separation Network (ACSNet) that explicitly takes into account context for accurate action localization. It consists of two branches (i.e., the Foreground-Background branch and the Action-Context branch). The ForegroundBackground branch first distinguishes foreground from background within the entire video while the Action-Context branch further separates the foreground as action and context. We associate video snippets with two latent components (i.e., a positive component and a negative component), and their different combinations can effectively characterize foreground, action and context. Furthermore, we introduce extended labels with auxiliary context categories to facilitate the learning of action-context separation. Experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.2/v1.3 datasets demonstrate the ACSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art WS-TAL methods by a large margin."

Most existing models follow the “localization by classification” procedure: locate temporal regions contributing most to the video-level classification. Generally, they process each snippet (or frame) individually and thus overlook the fruitful temporal context relation. Here arises the single snippet cheating issue: “hard” snippets are too vague to be classified. In this paper, we argue that learning by comparing helps identify these hard snippets and we propose to utilize snippet Contrastive learning to Localize Actions, CoLA for short. Specifically, we propose a Snippet Contrast (SniCo) Loss to refine the hard snippet representation in feature space, which guides the network to perceive precise temporal boundaries and avoid the temporal interval interruption. Besides, since it is infeasible to access frame-level annotations, we introduce a Hard Snippet Mining algorithm to locate the potential hard snippets. Substantial analyses verify that this mining strategy efficaciously captures the hard snippets and SniCo Loss leads to more informative feature representation. Extensive experiments show that CoLA achieves state-of-the-art results on THUMOS’14 and ActivityNet v1.2 datasets."

Considering the difficulty of acquiring dense labels, researchers have recently been resorting to weak labels to alleviate the annotation burden of segmentation. However, existing works mainly concentrate on expanding the seed of pseudo labels within the image’s salient region. In this work, we propose a non-salient region object mining approach for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. We introduce a graph-based global reasoning unit to strengthen the classification network’s ability to capture global relations among disjoint and distant regions. This helps the network activate the object features outside the salient area. To further mine the non-salient region objects, we propose to exert the segmentation network’s self-correction ability. Specifically, a potential object mining module is proposed to reduce the false-negative rate in pseudo labels. Moreover, we propose a non-salient region masking module for complex images to generate masked pseudo labels. Our non-salient region masking module helps further discover the objects in the non-salient region.

However, to achieve this, contemporary NMNs need strong supervision in executing the query as a specialized program over reasoning modules and fail to generalize to more open-ended settings without such supervision. Hence we propose Weakly-Supervised Neuro-Symbolic Module Network (WNSMN) trained with answers as the sole supervision for numerical reasoning based MRC. It learns to execute a noisy heuristic program obtained from the dependency parsing of the query, as discrete actions over both neural and symbolic reasoning modules and trains it end-to-end in a reinforcement learning framework with discrete reward from answer matching. On the numerical-answer subset of DROP, WNSMN outperforms NMN by 32% and the reasoning-free language model GenBERT by 8% in exact match accuracy when trained under comparable weak supervised settings.

While SED can be done using supervised machine learning, where training data is fully labeled with access to per event timestamps and duration, our work focuses on weakly-supervised sound event detection (WSSED), where prior knowledge about an event's duration is unavailable. Recent research within the field focuses on improving segment- and event-level localization performance for specific datasets regarding specific evaluation metrics. Specifically, well-performing event-level localization requires fully labeled development subsets to obtain event duration estimates, which significantly benefits localization performance. Moreover, well-performing segment-level localization models output predictions at a coarse-scale (e.g., 1 second), hindering their deployment on datasets containing very short events ($< $ 1 second). This work proposes a duration robust CRNN (CDur) framework, which aims to achieve competitive performance in terms of segment- and event-level localization. This paper proposes a new post-processing strategy named “Triple Threshold” and investigates two data augmentation methods along with a label smoothing method within the scope of WSSED. Evaluation of our model is done on the DCASE2017 and 2018 Task 4 datasets, and URBAN-SED. Our model outperforms other approaches on the DCASE2018 and URBAN-SED datasets without requiring prior duration knowledge. In particular, our model is capable of similar performance to strongly-labeled supervised models on the URBAN-SED dataset.

With only videolevel supervision during training, most existing methods rely on a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework to predict the start and end frame of each action category in a video. However, the existing MIL-based approach has a major limitation of only capturing the most discriminative frames of an action, ignoring the full extent of an activity. Moreover, these methods cannot model background activity effectively, which plays an important role in localizing foreground activities. In this paper, we present a novel framework named HAM-Net with a hybrid attention mechanism which includes temporal soft, semi-soft and hard attentions to address these issues. Our temporal soft attention module, guided by an auxiliary background class in the classification module, models the background activity by introducing an “action-ness” score for each video snippet. Moreover, our temporal semi-soft and hard attention modules, calculating two attention scores for each video snippet, help to focus on the less discriminative frames of an action to capture the full action boundary. Our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by at least 2.2% mAP at IoU threshold 0.5 on the THUMOS14 dataset, and by at least 1.3% mAP at IoU threshold 0.75 on the ActivityNet1.2 dataset.

There has been remarkable progress in fully-supervised temporal action localization (Tran et al. 2017; Zhao et al. 2017; Chao et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2019). However, annotating the precise temporal ranges of all action instances in a video dataset is expensive, time-consuming, and errorprone. On the contrary, weakly supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) can greatly simplify the data collection and annotation cost. WTAL aims at localizing and classifying all action instances in a video given only video-level category label during training stage. Most existing WTAL methods rely on the multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm (Paul, Roy, Copyright © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The advancement of Digital Twin technologies allows for realistic simulations of complex machinery; therefore, it is ideally suited to generate synthetic datasets for the use in anomaly detection approaches when compared to actual measurement data. In this article, we present novel weakly supervised approaches to anomaly detection for industrial settings. The approaches make use of a Digital Twin to generate a training dataset, which simulates the normal operation of the machinery, along with a small set of labeled anomalous measurement from the real machinery. In particular, we introduce a clustering-based approach, called cluster centers (CC), and a neural architecture based on the Siamese Autoencoders (SAE), which are tailored for weakly supervised settings with very few labeled data samples. The performance of the proposed methods is compared against various state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms on an application to a real-world dataset from a facility monitoring system, by using a multitude of performance measures. Also, the influence of hyperparameters related to feature extraction and network architecture is investigated.

Previous works have made progresses on discriminating whether a video sequence contains anomalies. However, most of them fail to accurately localize the anomalous events within videos in the temporal domain. In this paper, we propose a Weakly Supervised Anomaly Localization (WSAL) method focusing on temporally localizing anomalous segments within anomalous videos. Inspired by the appearance difference in anomalous videos, the evolution of adjacent temporal segments is evaluated for the localization of anomalous segments. To this end, a high-order context encoding model is proposed to not only extract semantic representations but also measure the dynamic variations so that the temporal context could be effectively utilized. In addition, in order to fully utilize the spatial context information, the immediate semantics are directly derived from the segment representations. The dynamic variations as well as the immediate semantics, are efficiently aggregated to obtain the final anomaly scores. An enhancement strategy is further proposed to deal with noise interference and the absence of localization guidance in anomaly detection. Moreover, to facilitate the diversity requirement for anomaly detection benchmarks, we also collect a new traffic anomaly (TAD) dataset which specifies in the traffic conditions, differing greatly from the current popular anomaly detection evaluation benchmarks.

In this study, we propose a pseudo-label-assisted point cloud segmentation method with very few sparsely sampled labels that are normally randomly selected for each class. An adaptive thresholding strategy was proposed to generate a pseudo-label based on the prediction probability. Pseudo-label learning is an iterative process, and pseudo labels were updated solely on ground-truth weak labels as the model converged to improve the training efficiency.

This task is challenging, as coarse annotations (tags, boxes) lack precise pixel localization whereas sparse annotations (points, scribbles) lack broad region coverage. Existing methods tackle these two types of weak supervision differently: Class activation maps are used to localize coarse labels and iteratively refine the segmentation model, whereas conditional random fields are used to propagate sparse labels to the entire image. We formulate weakly supervised segmentation as a semi-supervised metric learning problem, where pixels of the same (different) semantics need to be mapped to the same (distinctive) features. We propose 4 types of contrastive relationships between pixels and segments in the feature space, capturing low-level image similarity, semantic annotation, co-occurrence, and feature affinity They act as priors; the pixel-wise feature can be learned from training images with any partial annotations in a data-driven fashion.

Meanwhile, there are many different multimodal affect recognition datasets, though each may be small. In this paper, we propose to leverage these datasets using weakly-supervised multi-task learning to improve the generalization performance on each of them. Specifically, we explore three multimodal affect recognition tasks: 1) emotion recognition; 2) sentiment analysis; and 3) sarcasm recognition. Our experimental results show that multi-tasking can benefit all these tasks, achieving an improvement up to 2.9% accuracy and 3.3% F1-score. Furthermore, our method also helps to improve the stability of model performance. In addition, our analysis suggests that weak supervision can provide a comparable contribution to strong supervision if the tasks are highly correlated."

Previous works endeavor to perceive the interval objects from the small and sparse discriminative attention map, yet ignoring the co-occurrence confounder (e.g., bird and sky), which makes the model inspection (e.g., CAM) hard to distinguish between the object and context. In this paper, we make an early attempt to tackle this challenge via causal intervention (CI). Our proposed method, dubbed CI-CAM, explores the causalities among images, contexts, and categories to eliminate the biased co-occurrence in the class activation maps thus improving the accuracy of object localization. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CI-CAM in learning the clear object boundaries from confounding contexts. Particularly, in CUB-200-2011 which severely suffers from the co-occurrence confounder, CI-CAM significantly outperforms the traditional CAM-based baseline (58.39% vs 52.4% in top-1 localization accuracy). While in more general scenarios such as ImageNet, CI-CAM can also perform on par with the state of the arts."

We first create a graph with nodes representing candidate rules extracted from unlabeled data. Then, we design a new graph neural network to augment labeling rules by exploring the semantic relations between rules. We finally apply the augmented rules on unlabeled data to generate weak labels and train a NER model using the weakly labeled data.

To be specific, we devise a series of mechanisms of triple-view attention representation, attention expansion, and feature calibration. Unlike other attention-based WSOL methods that learn a coarse attention map, having the same values across elements in feature maps, our proposed RFGA learns fine-grained values in an attention map by assigning different attention values for each of the elements. We validated the superiority of our proposed RFGA module by comparing it with the recent methods in the literature over three datasets. Further, we analyzed the effect of each mechanism in our RFGA and visualized attention maps to get insights."

In this paper, we first investigate whether dense 3D labels are truly required for learning meaningful semantic representations. Interestingly, we find that the segmentation performance of existing works only drops slightly given as few as 1% of the annotations.

Traditional methods mainly focus on foreground and background frames separation with only a single attention branch and class activation sequence.

It does not make sense to group those context frames to the same background class since they are semantically related to a specific action category. Consequently, it is challenging to suppress action context frames with only a single class activation sequence. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an action-context modeling network termed ACM-Net, which integrates a three-branch attention module to measure the likelihood of each temporal point being action instance, context, or non-action background, simultaneously. Then based on the obtained three-branch attention values, we construct three-branch class activation sequences to represent the action instances, contexts, and non-action backgrounds, individually.

Most current approaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs), which can be generated from image-level annotations. Nevertheless, resulting maps have been demonstrated to be highly discriminant, failing to serve as optimal proxy pixel-level labels. We present a novel learning strategy that leverages self-supervision in a multi-modal image scenario to significantly enhance original CAMs. In particular, the proposed method is based on two observations. First, the learning of fully-supervised segmentation networks implicitly imposes equivariance by means of data augmentation, whereas this implicit constraint disappears on CAMs generated with image tags. And second, the commonalities between image modalities can be employed as an efficient self-supervisory signal, correcting the inconsistency shown by CAMs obtained across multiple modalities. To effectively train our model, we integrate a novel loss function that includes a within-modality and a cross-modality equivariant term to explicitly impose these constraints during training. In addition, we add a KL-divergence on the class prediction distributions to facilitate the information exchange between modalities, which, combined with the equivariant regularizers further improves the performance of our model. Exhaustive experiments on the popular multi-modal BRATS dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms relevant recent literature under the same learning conditions."

The adaptive sampler dynamically updates the input of the supplementary branch with a sampling weight sequence negatively correlated with the CAS from the base branch, thereby prompting the supplementary branch to localize the action regions underestimated by the base branch.

To implement this idea, we propose a novel pooling method, dubbed background-aware pooling (BAP), that focuses more on aggregating foreground features inside the bounding boxes using attention maps.

We introduce the token semantic coupled attention map (TSCAM) to take full advantage of the self-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency extraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for spatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency to avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related semantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object categories.

However, these models require voxel-wise labels which are time-consuming to draw for medical experts. An interesting alternative to voxel-wise annotations is the use of “weak labels”: these can be coarse or oversized annotations that are less precise, but considerably faster to create. In this work, we address the task of brain aneurysm detection by developing a fully automated, deep neural network that is trained utilizing oversized weak labels. Furthermore, since aneurysms mainly occur in specific anatomical locations, we build our model leveraging the underlying anatomy of the brain vasculature both during training and inference. We apply our model to 250 subjects (120 patients, 130 controls) who underwent Time-Of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (TOF-MRA) and presented a total of 154 aneurysms. To assess the robustness of the algorithm, we participated in a MICCAI challenge for TOF-MRA data (93 patients, 20 controls, 125 aneurysms) which allowed us to obtain results also for subjects coming from a different institution. Our network achieves an average sensitivity of 77% on our in-house data, with a mean False Positive (FP) rate of 0.72 per patient. Instead, on the challenge data, we attain a sensitivity of 59% with a mean FP rate of 1.18, ranking in 7th/14 position for detection and in 4th/11 for segmentation on the open leaderboard. When computing detection performances with respect to aneurysms’ risk of rupture, we found no statistical difference between two risk groups (p = 0.12), although the sensitivity for dangerous aneurysms was higher (78%). Our approach suggests that clinically useful sensitivity can be achieved using weak labels and exploiting prior anatomical knowledge; this expands the feasibility of deep learning studies to hospitals that have limited time and data available."

Although prior works struggled to localize objects through various spatial regularization strategies, we argue that how to extract object structural information from the trained classification network is neglected. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach, termed structure-preserving activation (SPA), toward fully leveraging the structure information incorporated in convolutional features for WSOL. First, a restricted activation module (RAM) is designed to alleviate the structuremissing issue caused by the classification network on the basis of the observation that the unbounded classification map and global average pooling layer drive the network to focus only on object parts. Second, we designed a post-process approach, termed self-correlation map generating (SCG) module to obtain structure-preserving localization maps on the basis of the activation maps acquired from the first stage. Specifically, we utilize the high-order self-correlation (HSC) to extract the inherent structural information retained in the learned model and then aggregate HSC of multiple points for precise object localization. Extensive experiments on two publicly available benchmarks including CUB-2002011 and ILSVRC show that the proposed SPA achieves substantial and consistent performance gains compared with baseline approaches.

By providing massive training samples, it helps to improve the generalization ability of the model. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that has been deeply studied in recent years, conventional data augmentation approaches for WSSS usually employ geometrical transformations, random cropping and color jittering. However, merely increasing the same contextual semantic data does not bring much gain to the networks to distinguish the objects, e.g., the correct image-level classification of""aeroplane""may be not only due to the recognition of the object itself, but also its co-occurrence context like""sky"", which will cause the model to focus less on the object features. To this end, we present a Context Decoupling Augmentation (CDA) method, to change the inherent context in which the objects appear and thus drive the network to remove the dependence between object instances and contextual information. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with several alternative network architectures demonstrate that CDA can boost various popular WSSS methods to the new state-of-the-art by a large margin."

The EDNN is naturally able to accurately perform multi-class counting using only ground truth count values as labels. Without providing any conceptual information, object annotations, or pixel segmentation information, the neural network is able to formulate its own conceptual representation of the items in the image. Using images labelled with only the counts of the objects present, the structure of the extensive deep neural network can be exploited to perform localization of the objects within the visual field. We demonstrate that a trained EDNN can be used to count objects in images much larger than those on which it was trained. In order to demonstrate our technique, we introduce seven new datasets: five progressively harder MNIST digit-counting data sets, and two data sets of 3d-rendered rubber ducks in various situations. On most of these datasets, the EDNN achieves greater than 99% test set accuracy in counting objects."

To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stream framework for audio tagging by exploiting the global and local information of sound events. The global stream aims to analyze the whole audio clip in order to capture the local clips that need to be attended using a class-wise selection module. These clips are then fed to the local stream to exploit the detailed information for a better decision. Experimental results on the AudioSet show that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of audio tagging under different baseline network architectures."

Although current methods show effective detection performance, their recognition of the positive instances, i.e., rare abnormal snippets in the abnormal videos, is largely biased by the dominant negative instances, especially when the abnormal events are subtle anomalies that exhibit only small differences compared with normal events. This issue is exacerbated in many methods that ignore important video temporal dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and theoretically sound method, named Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude learning (RTFM), which trains a feature magnitude learning function to effectively recognise the positive instances, substantially improving the robustness of the MIL approach to the negative instances from abnormal videos. RTFM also adapts dilated convolutions and self-attention mechanisms to capture long- and short-range temporal dependencies to learn the feature magnitude more faithfully. Extensive experiments show that the RTFM-enabled MIL model (i) outperforms several state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on three benchmark data sets (ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence) and (ii) achieves significantly improved subtle anomaly discriminability and sample efficiency.

However, collecting instancelevel annotations for various thoracic diseases is expensive. Therefore, weakly supervised localization methods have been proposed that use only image-level annotation. While the previous methods presented the disease location as the most discriminative part for classification, this causes a deep network to localize wrong areas for indistinguishable X-ray images. To solve this issue, we propose a spatial attention method using disease masks that describe the areas where diseases mainly occur. We then apply the spatial attention to find the precise disease area by highlighting the highest probability of disease occurrence. Meanwhile, the various sizes, rotations and noise in chest X-ray images make generating the disease masks challenging. To reduce the variation among images, we employ an alignment module to transform an input X-ray image into a generalized image. Through extensive experiments on the NIH-Chest X-ray dataset with eight kinds of diseases, we show that the proposed method results in superior localization performances compared to state-of-the-art methods."

However, annotating biomedical images is knowledge-driven, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, making it difficult to obtain abundant labels with limited costs. Active learning strategies come into ease the burden of human annotation, which queries only a subset of training data for annotation. Despite receiving attention, most of active learning methods generally still require huge computational costs and utilize unlabeled data inefficiently. They also tend to ignore the intermediate knowledge within networks. In this work, we propose a deep active semi-supervised learning framework, DSAL, combining active learning and semi-supervised learning strategies. In DSAL, a new criterion based on deep supervision mechanism is proposed to select informative samples with high uncertainties and low uncertainties for strong labelers and weak labelers respectively. The internal criterion leverages the disagreement of intermediate features within the deep learning network for active sample selection, which subsequently reduces the computational costs. We use the proposed criteria to select samples for strong and weak labelers to produce oracle labels and pseudo labels simultaneously at each active learning iteration in an ensemble learning manner, which can be examined with IoMT Platform. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art active learning methods."

The proposed framework was tailored to glioblastoma, a type of malignant tumor characterized by its diffuse infiltration into the surrounding brain tissue, which poses significant challenge to treatment target and tumor burden estimation based on conventional structural MRI. Although physiological MRI can provide more specific information regarding tumor infiltration, the relatively low resolution hinders a precise full annotation. This has motivated us to develop a weakly supervised deep learning solution that exploits the partial labelled tumor regions. EMReDL contains two components: a physiological prior prediction model and EM-regularized segmentation model. The physiological prior prediction model exploits the physiological MRI by training a classifier to generate a physiological prior map. This map was passed to the segmentation model for regularization using the EM algorithm. We evaluated the model on a glioblastoma dataset with the available pre-operative multiparametric MRI and recurrence MRI. EMReDL was shown to effectively segment the infiltrated tumor from the partially labelled region of potential infiltration. The segmented core and infiltrated tumor showed high consistency with the tumor burden labelled by experts. The performance comparison showed that EMReDL achieved higher accuracy than published stateof-the-art models. On MR spectroscopy, the segmented region showed more aggressive features than other partial labelled region. The proposed model can be generalized to other segmentation tasks with partial labels, with the CNN architecture flexible in the framework. ∗Equal contribution †Current affiliation Preprint.

The training process in these methods is formulated into two steps. They firstly train a neural network under weak supervision to generate pseudo ground truths (PGTs). Then, these PGTs are used to train another network under full supervision. Compared with fully supervised methods, the training process in weakly supervised methods becomes more complex and time-consuming. Furthermore, overwhelming negative proposals are involved at the first step. This is neglected by most methods, which makes the training network biased towards to negative proposals and thus degrades the quality of the PGTs, limiting the training network performance at the second step. Online proposal sampling is an intuitive solution to these issues. However, lacking of adequate labeling, a simple online proposal sampling may make the training network stuck into local minima. To solve this problem, we propose an Online Active Proposal Set Generation (OPG) algorithm. Our OPG algorithm consists of two parts: Dynamic Proposal Constraint (DPC) and Proposal Partition (PP). DPC is proposed to dynamically determine different proposal sampling strategy according to the current training state. PP is used to score each proposal, part proposals into different sets and generate an active proposal set for the network optimization. Through experiments, our proposed OPG shows consistent and significant improvement on both datasets PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012, yielding comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results."

This allows the supervision to be aligned with the property of saliency detection, where the salient objects of an image could be from more than one class. To this end, we propose a model with two modules, Saliency Subitizing Module (SSM) and Saliency Updating Module (SUM). While SSM learns to generate the initial saliency masks using the subitizing information, without the need for any unsupervised methods or some random seeds, SUM helps iteratively refine the generated saliency masks. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets.

This makes the data annotation cost a significant bottleneck when deploying crack detection systems in real life. To resolve this issue, we formulate the crack detection problem as a weakly-supervised problem and propose a two-branched framework.

CEDG transfers networks from a publicly available source domain to an application-specific target domain through an automatically allocated synthetic domain. The target domain is isolated from parameters tuning and used for model selection and testing only. The target domain is significantly different from the source domain because it has new target categories and is consisted of low-quality images that are out of focus, low in resolution, low in illumination, low in photographing angle. The trained network has about 7M (ResNet-20 is about 41M) multiplications per prediction that is small enough to allow a digital signal processor chip to do real-time recognitions in our WSN.

The problem is complex because of the lack of annotated data for the different semantic regions to segment, thus discouraging the use of strongly supervised approaches. We, therefore, propose a weakly supervised and efficient interactive segmentation method to solve this challenging problem. After segmenting the wrapped mummy from its exterior region using histogram analysis and template matching, we first design a voxel distance measure to find an approximate solution for the body and bandage segments. Here, we use geodesic distances since voxel features as well as spatial relationship among voxels is incorporated in this measure. Next, we refine the solution using a GrabCut based segmentation together with a tracking method on the slices of the scan that assigns labels to different regions in the volume, using limited supervision in the form of scribbles drawn by the user. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated using visualizations and validated through quantitative measures and qualitative unwrapping of the mummy."

This module contains two key components, the channel attention guided dropout (CAGD) and the spatial attention guided dropblock (SAGD). To model channel interdependencies, the CAGD ranks the channel attentions and treats the top-k attentions with the largest magnitudes as the important ones. It also keeps some low-valued elements to increase their value if they become important during training. The SAGD can efficiently remove the most discriminative information by erasing the contiguous regions of feature maps rather than individual pixels. This guides the model to capture the less discriminative parts for classification. Furthermore, it can also distinguish the foreground objects from the background regions to alleviate the attention misdirection.

Also, most of the generic object detectors process axis-aligned rectangular areas though, a thin and long rifle may actually cover only a small percentage of that area and the rest may contain irrelevant details suppressing the required object signatures. To handle these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised Orientation Aware Object Detection (OAOD) algorithm which learns to detect oriented object bounding boxes (OBB) while using Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) for training. The proposed OAOD is different from the existing oriented object detectors which strictly require OBB during training which may not always be present. The goal of training on AABB and detection of OBB is achieved by employing a multistage scheme, with Stage-1 predicting the AABB and Stage-2 predicting OBB. In-between the two stages, the oriented proposal generation module along with the object aligned RoI pooling is designed to extract features based on the predicted orientation and to make these features orientation invariant.

For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious; the COVID-19 lesions are localized by combining the activation regions in the classification network and the unsupervised connected components. 499 CT volumes were used for training and 131 CT volumes were used for testing. Our algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient’s CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability and discover lesion regions in chest CT without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives. Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies."

Most of advanced solutions exploit class activation map (CAM). However, CAMs can hardly serve as the object mask due to the gap between full and weak supervisions. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised equivariant attention mechanism (SEAM) to discover additional supervision and narrow the gap. Our method is based on the observation that equivariance is an implicit constraint in fully supervised semantic segmentation, whose pixel-level labels take the same spatial transformation as the input images during data augmentation. However, this constraint is lost on the CAMs trained by image-level supervision. Therefore, we propose consistency regularization on predicted CAMs from various transformed images to provide self-supervision for network learning. Moreover, we propose a pixel correlation module (PCM), which exploits context appearance information and refines the prediction of current pixel by its similar neighbors, leading to further improvement on CAMs consistency. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods using the same level of supervision. The code is released online."

However, using scribble labels to learn salient object detection has not been explored. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised salient object detection model to learn saliency from such annotations. In doing so, we first relabel an existing large-scale salient object detection dataset with scribbles, namely S-DUTS dataset. Since object structure and detail information is not identified by scribbles, directly training with scribble labels will lead to saliency maps of poor boundary localization. To mitigate this problem, we propose an auxiliary edge detection task to localize object edges explicitly, and a gated structure-aware loss to place constraints on the scope of structure to be recovered. Moreover, we design a scribble boosting scheme to iteratively consolidate our scribble annotations, which are then employed as supervision to learn high-quality saliency maps. As existing saliency evaluation metrics neglect to measure structure alignment of the predictions, the saliency map ranking may not comply with human perception. We present a new metric, termed saliency structure measure, as a complementary metric to evaluate sharpness of the prediction. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing weakly-supervised/unsupervised methods, but also is on par with several fully-supervised state-of-the-art models (Our code and data is publicly available at: https://github.com/JingZhang617/Scribble_Saliency)."

However, these strategies rely on full localization supervision to validate hyperparameters and for model selection, which is in principle prohibited under the WSOL setup. In this paper, we argue that WSOL task is ill-posed with only image-level labels, and propose a new evaluation protocol where full supervision is limited to only a small held-out set not overlapping with the test set.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when segmenting natural images with huge labeled datasets, their successful translation to remote sensing tasks has been limited by low quantities of ground truth labels, especially fully segmented ones, in the remote sensing domain. In this work, we perform cropland segmentation using two types of labels commonly found in remote sensing datasets that can be considered sources of “weak supervision”: (1) labels comprised of single geotagged points and (2) image-level labels. We demonstrate that (1) a U-Net trained on a single labeled pixel per image and (2) a U-Net image classifier transferred to segmentation can outperform pixel-level algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. While the high performance of neural networks is well-established for large datasets, our experiments indicate that U-Nets trained on weak labels outperform baseline methods with as few as 100 labels.

Models built for simultaneous object localization and segmentation have been explored in the conventional fully supervised learning scenario to boost the performance of each task. However, none of the existing works has attempted to jointly learn object localization and segmentation models under weak supervision. To this end, we propose a joint learning framework called Self-Paced Fine-Tuning Network (SPFTN) for localizing and segmenting objects in weakly labelled videos. Learning the deep model jointly for object localization and segmentation under weak supervision is very challenging as the learning process of each single task would face serious ambiguity issue due to the lack of bounding-box or pixel-level supervision. To address this problem, our proposed deep SPFTN model is carefully designed with a novel multi-task self-paced learning objective, which leverages the task-specific prior knowledge and the knowledge that has been already captured to infer the confident training samples for each task. By aggregating the confident knowledge from each single task to mine reliable patterns and learning deep feature representation for both tasks, the proposed learning framework can address the ambiguity issue under weak supervision with simple optimization.

The general framework largely relies on the classification activation, which employs an attention model to identify the action-related frames and then categorizes them into different classes. Such method results in the action-context confusion issue: context frames near action clips tend to be recognized as action frames themselves, since they are closely related to the specific classes. To solve the problem, in this paper we propose to model the class-agnostic frame-wise probability conditioned on the frame attention using conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). With the observation that the context exhibits notable difference from the action at representation level, a probabilistic model, i.e., conditional VAE, is learned to model the likelihood of each frame given the attention. By maximizing the conditional probability with respect to the attention, the action and non-action frames are well separated. Experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2 demonstrate advantage of our method and effectiveness in handling action-context confusion problem. Code is now available on GitHub."

Current popular solutions leverage object localization maps from classifiers as supervision signals, and struggle to make the localization maps capture more complete object content. Rather than previous efforts that primarily focus on intra-image information, we address the value of cross-image semantic relations for comprehensive object pattern mining. To achieve this, two neural co-attentions are incorporated into the classifier to complimentarily capture cross-image semantic similarities and differences. In particular, given a pair of training images, one co-attention enforces the classifier to recognize the common semantics from co-attentive objects, while the other one, called contrastive co-attention, drives the classifier to identify the unshared semantics from the rest, uncommon objects. This helps the classifier discover more object patterns and better ground semantics in image regions. In addition to boosting object pattern learning, the co-attention can leverage context from other related images to improve localization map inference, hence eventually benefiting semantic segmentation learning. More essentially, our algorithm provides a unified framework that handles well different WSSS settings, i.e., learning WSSS with (1) precise image-level supervision only, (2) extra simple single-label data, and (3) extra noisy web data. It sets new state-of-the-arts on all these settings, demonstrating well its efficacy and generalizability.

Specifically, we perform clustering on image features to generate pseudo sub-categories labels within each annotated parent class, and construct a sub-category objective to assign the network to a more challenging task. By iteratively clustering image features, the training process does not limit itself to the most discriminative object parts, hence improving the quality of the response maps.

In this work, we harness the image-level labels to produce reliable pixel-level annotations and design a fully end-to-end network to learn to predict segmentation maps. Concretely, we firstly leverage an image classification branch to generate class activation maps for the annotated categories, which are further pruned into confident yet tiny object/background regions. Such reliable regions are then directly served as ground-truth labels for the parallel segmentation branch, where a newly designed dense energy loss function is adopted for optimization.

Furthermore, we integrate our deep tightness prior with a global background emptiness constraint, guiding training with information outside the bounding box. We demonstrate experimentally that such a global constraint is much more powerful than standard cross-entropy for the background class. Our optimization problem is challenging as it takes the form of a large set of inequality constraints on the outputs of deep networks. We solve it with sequence of unconstrained losses based on a recent powerful extension of the log-barrier method, which is well-known in the context of interior-point methods. This accommodates standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for training deep networks, while avoiding computationally expensive and unstable Lagrangian dual steps and projections.

Via social media platforms, fake news travel at unprecedented speeds, reach global audiences and put users and communities at great risk. Therefore, it is extremely important to detect fake news as early as possible. Recently, deep learning based approaches have shown improved performance in fake news detection. However, the training of such models requires a large amount of labeled data, but manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, due to the dynamic nature of news, annotated samples may become outdated quickly and cannot represent the news articles on newly emerged events. Therefore, how to obtain fresh and high-quality labeled samples is the major challenge in employing deep learning models for fake news detection. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a reinforced weakly-supervised fake news detection framework, i.e., WeFEND, which can leverage users' reports as weak supervision to enlarge the amount of training data for fake news detection. The proposed framework consists of three main components: the annotator, the reinforced selector and the fake news detector. The annotator can automatically assign weak labels for unlabeled news based on users' reports. The reinforced selector using reinforcement learning techniques chooses high-quality samples from the weakly labeled data and filters out those low-quality ones that may degrade the detector's prediction performance. The fake news detector aims to identify fake news based on the news content. We tested the proposed framework on a large collection of news articles published via WeChat official accounts and associated user reports.

But with the increasing demand for large scale data, the need of hand annotated data for the training becomes more and more impractical. One way to avoid frame-based human annotation is the use of action order information to learn the respective action classes. In this context, we propose a hierarchical approach to address the problem of weakly supervised learning of human actions from ordered action labels by structuring recognition in a coarse-to-fine manner. Given a set of videos and an ordered list of the occurring actions, the task is to infer start and end frames of the related action classes within the video and to train the respective action classifiers without any need for hand labeled frame boundaries. We address this problem by combining a framewise RNN model with a coarse probabilistic inference. This combination allows for the temporal alignment of long sequences and thus, for an iterative training of both elements. While this system alone already generates good results, we show that the performance can be further improved by approximating the number of subactions to the characteristics of the different action classes as well as by the introduction of a regularizing length prior. The proposed system is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, the Breakfast and the Hollywood extended dataset, showing a competitive performance on various weak learning tasks such as temporal action segmentation and action alignment."

Exploiting only one activation map of the highest probability class is often biased into limited regions or sometimes even highlights background regions. To resolve these limitations, we propose to use activation maps, named combinational class activation maps (CCAM), which are linear combinations of activation maps from the highest to the lowest probability class. By using CCAM for localization, we suppress background regions to help highlighting foreground objects more accurately. In addition, we design the network architecture to consider spatial relationships for localizing relevant object regions. Specifically, we integrate non-local modules into an existing base network at both low- and high-level layers. Our final model, named non-local combinational class activation maps (NL-CCAM), obtains superior performance compared to previous methods on representative object localization benchmarks including ILSVRC 2016 and CUB- 200-2011. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method has a great capability of generalization by visualizing other datasets."

One challenge of the SED task is that many datasets such as the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) datasets are weakly labelled. That is, there are only audio tags for each audio clip without the onset and offset times of sound events. We compare segment-wise and clip-wise training for SED that is lacking in previous works. We propose a convolutional neural network transformer (CNN-Transfomer) for audio tagging and SED, and show that CNN-Transformer performs similarly to a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). Another challenge of SED is that thresholds are required for detecting sound events. Previous works set thresholds empirically, and are not an optimal approaches. To solve this problem, we propose an automatic threshold optimization method. The first stage is to optimize the system with respect to metrics that do not depend on thresholds, such as mean average precision (mAP). The second stage is to optimize the thresholds with respect to metrics that depends on those thresholds. Our proposed automatic threshold optimization system achieves a state-of-the-art audio tagging F1 of 0.646, outperforming that without threshold optimization of 0.629, and a sound event detection F1 of 0.584, outperforming that without threshold optimization of 0.564."

As a challenging problem for high-level video understanding, weakly supervised action recognition and localization in untrimmed videos have attracted intensive research attention. Knowledge transfer by leveraging the publicly available trimmed videos as external guidance is a promising attempt to make up for the coarse-grained video-level annotation and improve the generalization performance. However, unconstrained knowledge transfer may bring about irrelevant noise and jeopardize the learning model. This article proposes a novel adaptability decomposing encoder-decoder network to transfer reliable knowledge between the trimmed and untrimmed videos for action recognition and localization by bidirectional point process modeling, given only video-level annotations. By decomposing the original features into the domain-adaptable and domain-specific ones based on their adaptability, trimmed-untrimmed knowledge transfer can be safely confined within a more coherent subspace. An encoder-decoder-based structure is carefully designed and jointly optimized to facilitate effective action classification and temporal localization. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark data sets (i.e., THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3), and the experimental results clearly corroborate the efficacy of our method."

When in-domain labelled data is available, transfer learning techniques can be used to adapt existing NER models to the target domain. But what should one do when there is no hand-labelled data for the target domain? This paper presents a simple but powerful approach to learn NER models in the absence of labelled data through weak supervision. The approach relies on a broad spectrum of labelling functions to automatically annotate texts from the target domain. These annotations are then merged together using a hidden Markov model which captures the varying accuracies and confusions of the labelling functions. A sequence labelling model can finally be trained on the basis of this unified annotation. We evaluate the approach on two English datasets (CoNLL 2003 and news articles from Reuters and Bloomberg) and demonstrate an improvement of about 7 percentage points in entity-level $F_1$ scores compared to an out-of-domain neural NER model."

Specifically, our effort starts with some generic segment-based object proposals (SOP) without category priors. We propose a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, which can be trained in an end-to-end manner using training images with image-level labels. For each proposal, this MIL framework can simultaneously compute probability distributions and category-aware semantic features, with which we can formulate a large undirected graph. The category of background is also included in this graph to remove the massive noisy object proposals. An optimal multi-way cut of this graph can thus assign a reliable category label to each proposal. The denoised SOP with assigned category labels can be viewed as pseudo instance segmentation of training images, which are used to train fully supervised models. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for both weakly supervised instance segmentation and semantic segmentation."

However, in spite of recent growth in the availability of satellite observations, accurate training data remains comparably scarce. On the other hand, numerous global land cover products exist and can be accessed often free-of-charge. Unfortunately, these maps are typically of a much lower resolution than modern day satellite imagery. Besides, they always come with a significant amount of noise, as they cannot be considered ground truth, but are products of previous (semi-)automatic prediction tasks. Therefore, this paper seeks to make a case for the application of weakly supervised learning strategies to get the most out of available data sources and achieve progress in high-resolution large-scale land cover mapping.

Despite recent advances, existing methods for weakly-supervised temporal activity localization struggle to recognize when an activity is not occurring. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named A2CL-PT. Two triplets of the feature space are considered in our approach: one triplet is used to learn discriminative features for each activity class, and the other one is used to distinguish the features where no activity occurs (i.e. background features) from activity-related features for each video. To further improve the performance, we build our network using two parallel branches which operate in an adversarial way: the first branch localizes the most salient activities of a video and the second one finds other supplementary activities from non-localized parts of the video. Extensive experiments performed on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is effective.

In this paper, we argue that the critical factor preventing to obtain the full object mask is the classification boundary mismatch problem in applying the CAM to WSSS. Because the CAM is optimized by the classification task, it focuses on the discrimination across different image-level classes. However, the WSSS requires to distinguish pixels sharing the same image-level class to separate them into the foreground and the background. To alleviate this contradiction, we propose an efficient end-to-end Intra-Class Discriminator (ICD) framework, which learns intra-class boundaries to help separate the foreground and the background within each image-level class. Without bells and whistles, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance of image label based WSSS, with mIoU 68.0% on the VOC 2012 semantic segmentation benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

In our setting, the 3D weak labels only indicate the classes that appeared in our input sample.

Most previous models use attention-based approaches applying attentions to generate the bag's representation from instances, and then train it via the bag's classification.

It is well established that characterizing features of different subordinate categories are located on local parts of object instances. However, manually annotating object parts requires expertise, which is also difficult to generalize to new fine-grained categorization tasks. In this work, we propose a Weakly Supervised Part Detection Network (PartNet) that is able to detect discriminative local parts for the use of fine-grained categorization. A vanilla PartNet builds on top of a base subnetwork two parallel streams of upper network layers, which respectively compute scores of classification probabilities (over subordinate categories) and detection probabilities (over a specified number of discriminative part detectors) for local regions of interest (RoIs). The image-level prediction is obtained by aggregating element-wise products of these region-level probabilities, and meanwhile diverse part detectors can be learned in an end-to-end fashion under the image-level supervision.

It is, however, a very challenging task because it is not straightforward to associate tags to visual appearance. Existing researches can only do tag-based WSSS on simple images, where only two or three tags exist in each image, and different images usually have different tags, such as the PASCAL VOC dataset. Therefore, it is easy to relate the tags to visual appearance and supervise the segmentation. However, real-world scenes are much more complex. Especially, the autonomous driving scenes usually contain nearly 20 tags in each image and those tags can repetitively appear from image to image, which means the existing simple image strategy does not work. In this paper, we propose to solve the problem by using region based deep clustering. The key idea is that, since each tagged object is repetitively appearing from image to image, it allows us to find the common appearance through region clustering, and particular deep neural network based clustering. Later, we relate the clustered region appearance to tags and utilize the tags to supervise the segmentation. Furthermore, regions found by clustering with weak supervision can be very noisy.

However, these techniques are limited to cover only the most discriminative part of the object and not the entire object. To address this problem, we propose an attention-based dropout layer, which utilizes the attention mechanism to locate the entire object efficiently. To achieve this, we devise two key components; 1) hiding the most discriminative part from the model to capture the entire object, and 2) highlighting the informative region to improve the classification accuracy of the model. These allow the classifier to be maintained with a reasonable accuracy while the entire object is covered. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves the weakly supervised single object localization accuracy, thereby achieving a new state-of-the-art localization accuracy on the CUB-200-2011 and a comparable accuracy to existing state-of-the-arts on the ImageNet-1k. The proposed method is also effective in improving the weakly supervised semantic segmentation performance on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO. Furthermore, the proposed method is more efficient than existing techniques in terms of parameter and computation overheads. Additionally, the proposed method can be easily applied in various backbone networks."

We refer to the proposed methodology as SeCoST (pronounced Sequest) — Sequential Co-supervision for training generations of Students. SeCoST incrementally builds a cascade of student-teacher pairs via a novel knowledge transfer method.

To achieve this, a clustering loss is adopted to separate actions from backgrounds and learn intra-compact features, which helps in detecting complete action instances. Besides, a similarity weighting module is devised to further separate actions from backgrounds. To effectively identify actions, we propose to construct relations among actions for prototype learning. A GCN-based prototype embedding module is introduced to generate relational prototypes.

Specifically, we synthesize boundary annotations by exploiting coarse localization maps obtained from CNN classifier, and use annotations to train the proposed network called BENet which further excavates more object boundaries to provide constraints for segmentation. Finally generated pseudo annotations of training images are used to supervise an off-the-shelf segmentation network.

However, a long-standing problem for available techniques based on the classification network is that they often result in highlighting the most discriminative parts rather than the entire extent of object. Nevertheless, trying to explore the integral extent of the object could degrade the performance of image classification on the contrary. To remedy this, we propose a simple yet powerful approach by introducing a novel adversarial erasing technique, erasing integrated learning (EIL). By integrating discriminative region mining and adversarial erasing in a single forward-backward propagation in a vanilla CNN, the proposed EIL explores the high response class-specific area and the less discriminative region simultaneously, thus could maintain high performance in classification and jointly discover the full extent of the object. Furthermore, we apply multiple EIL (MEIL) modules at different levels of the network in a sequential manner, which for the first time integrates semantic features of multiple levels and multiple scales through adversarial erasing learning. In particular, the proposed EIL and advanced MEIL both achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC 2016 benchmark, making significant improvement in localization while advancing high performance in image classification."

In this paper, we introduce a weakly supervised coupled convolutional network (WSCNet). Our method is dedicated to automatically selecting relevant soft proposals given weak annotations (e.g., global image labels), thereby significantly reducing the annotation burden, and encompasses the following contributions. First, the proposed WSCNet detects a sentiment-specific soft map by training a fully convolutional network with the cross spatial pooling strategy in the detection branch. Second, both the holistic and localized information are utilized by coupling the sentiment map with deep features as semantic vector in the classification branch. The sentiment detection and classification branches are integrated into a unified deep framework optimized in an end-to-end manner.

Thus, having a system that automatically detects COVID-19 in tomography (CT) images can assist in quantifying the severity of the illness. Unfortunately, labelling chest CT scans requires significant domain expertise, time, and effort. We address these labelling challenges by only requiring point annotations, a single pixel for each infected region on a CT image. This labeling scheme allows annotators to label a pixel in a likely infected region, only taking 1-3 seconds, as opposed to 10-15 seconds to segment a region. Conventionally, segmentation models train on point-level annotations using the cross-entropy loss function on these labels. However, these models often suffer from low precision. Thus, we propose a consistency-based (CB) loss function that encourages the output predictions to be consistent with spatial transformations of the input images. The experiments on 3 open-source COVID-19 datasets show that this loss function yields significant improvement over conventional point-level loss functions and almost matches the performance of models trained with full supervision with much less human effort.

Solving this problem can be challenging if, during optimization, the automated method cannot access information about the location of the lesions nor is given single examples of the lesions. We propose a new weakly supervised detection method using neural networks, that computes attention maps revealing the locations of brain lesions. These attention maps are computed using the last feature maps of a segmentation network optimized only with global image-level labels. The proposed method can generate attention maps at full input resolution without need for interpolation during preprocessing, which allows small lesions to appear in attention maps. For comparison, we modify state-of-the-art methods to compute attention maps for weakly supervised object detection, by using a global regression objective instead of the more conventional classification objective. This regression objective optimizes the number of occurrences of the target object in an image, e.g. the number of brain lesions in a scan, or the number of digits in an image. We study the behavior of the proposed method in MNIST-based detection datasets, and evaluate it for the challenging detection of enlarged perivascular spaces - a type of brain lesion - in a dataset of 2202 3D scans with point-wise annotations in the center of all lesions in four brain regions. In MNIST-based datasets, the proposed method outperforms the other methods. In the brain dataset, the weakly supervised detection methods come close to the human intrarater agreement in each region. The proposed method reaches the best area under the curve in two out of four regions, and has the lowest number of false positive detections in all regions, while its average sensitivity over all regions is similar to that of the other best methods.

The main difficulty is that seeds are usually sparse and incomplete. Related works typically try to alleviate this problem by adopting many bells and whistles to enhance the seeds. Instead of struggling to refine a single seed, we propose a novel approach to alleviate the inaccurate seed problem by leveraging the segmentation model’s robustness to learn from multiple seeds. We managed to generate many different seeds for each image, which are different estimates of the underlying ground truth. The segmentation model simultaneously exploits these seeds to learn and automatically decides the confidence of each seed.

Recent methods have exploited classification networks to localize objects by selecting regions with strong response. While such response map provides sparse information, however, there exist strong pairwise relations between pixels in natural images, which can be utilized to propagate the sparse map to a much denser one. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to learn such pairwise relations, which consists of two branches, a unary segmentation network which learns the label probabilities for each pixel, and a pairwise affinity network which learns affinity matrix and refines the probability map generated from the unary network. The refined results by the pairwise network are then used as supervision to train the unary network, and the procedures are conducted iteratively to obtain better segmentation progressively. To learn reliable pixel affinity without accurate annotation, we also propose to mine confident regions. We show that iteratively training this framework is equivalent to optimizing an energy function with convergence to a local minimum.

Therefore, we propose a novel module called RRPN (relational region proposal network) which outputs an object-localizing attention map only with human poses and action verbs. In the source domain, we fully train an object detector and the RRPN with full supervision of HOI. With transferred knowledge about localization map from the trained RRPN, a new object detector can learn unseen objects with weak verbal supervision of HOI without bounding box annotations in the target domain. Because the RRPN is designed as an add-on type, we can apply it not only to the object detection but also to other domains such as semantic segmentation.

We address this challenge introducing a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system that accelerates the labeling of CT scan images. Conventionally, active learning methods require the labelers to annotate whole images with full supervision, but that can lead to wasted efforts as many of the annotations could be redundant. Thus, our system presents the annotator with unlabeled regions that promise high information content and low annotation cost. Further, the system allows annotators to label regions using point-level supervision, which is much cheaper to acquire than per-pixel annotations. Our experiments on open-source COVID-19 datasets show that using an entropy-based method to rank unlabeled regions yields to significantly better results than random labeling of these regions. Also, we show that labeling small regions of images is more efficient than labeling whole images.

Typically, such segmentation tasks require significant effort to manually generate accurate pixel-wise annotations for fully supervised training. To alleviate such tedious and manual effort, in this paper we propose a novel weakly supervised segmentation framework based on partial points annotation, i.e., only a small portion of nuclei locations in each image are labeled. The framework consists of two learning stages. In the first stage, we design a semi-supervised strategy to learn a detection model from partially labeled nuclei locations. Specifically, an extended Gaussian mask is designed to train an initial model with partially labeled data. Then, self-training with background propagation is proposed to make use of the unlabeled regions to boost nuclei detection and suppress false positives. In the second stage, a segmentation model is trained from the detected nuclei locations in a weakly-supervised fashion. Two types of coarse labels with complementary information are derived from the detected points and are then utilized to train a deep neural network. The fully-connected conditional random field loss is utilized in training to further refine the model without introducing extra computational complexity during inference.

Using weak labels is both practical and useful, since (i) collecting image-level target annotations is comparably cheap in WDA and incurs no cost in UDA, and (ii) it opens the opportunity for category-wise domain alignment. Our framework uses weak labels to enable the interplay between feature alignment and pseudo-labeling, improving both in the process of domain adaptation. Specifically, we develop a weak-label classification module to enforce the network to attend to certain categories, and then use such training signals to guide the proposed category-wise alignment method.

However, using state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models in real-world pain estimation applications poses several challenges related to the subjective variations of facial expressions, operational capture conditions, and lack of representative training videos with labels. Given the cost of annotating intensity levels for every video frame, we propose a weakly-supervised domain adaptation (WSDA) technique that allows for training 3D CNNs for spatiotemporal pain intensity estimation using weakly labeled videos, where labels are provided on a periodic basis. In particular, WSDA integrates multiple instance learning into an adversarial deep domain adaptation framework to train an Inflated 3D-CNN (I3D) model such that it can accurately estimate pain intensities in the target operational domain. The training process relies on weak target loss, along with domain loss and source loss for domain adaptation of the I3D model.

To obtain distinct class-specific saliency maps (DCSM) that can be used as unary potentials of CRF, we propose a novel method of estimating class saliency maps, which significantly improves the method proposed by Simonyan et al. (2014) through the following improvements: (1) using CNN derivatives with respect to feature maps of the intermediate convolutional layers with up-sampling instead of an input image; (2) subtracting the saliency maps of other classes from the saliency maps of the target class to differentiate target objects among other objects; (3) aggregating multiple-scale class saliency maps to compensate for the low resolution in feature maps. In addition, we propose the use of a novel algorithm for estimating segmentation “Easiness” combined with the proposed saliency-based method. Wei et al. (2016) recently demonstrated that a fully supervised segmentation model enhanced the performance of weakly supervised segmentation by training the model using the estimated initial masks in a weakly supervised setting. However, the initial estimated masks tend to include some noise, which sometimes produces erroneous results. Therefore, we focus on improving the quality of the initial estimated masks for training a fully supervised segmentation model. We propose a method for retrieving “good seeds” by predicting the segmentation “Easiness” of images based on the consistency of the outputs under different conditions. We illustrate that our proposed method can retrieve “good seeds”.

Numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this problem through mining object proposals. However, a substantial amount of noise in object proposals causes ambiguities for learning discriminative object models. Such approaches are sensitive to model initialization and often converge to undesirable local minimum solutions. In this paper, we propose to overcome these drawbacks by progressive representation adaptation with two main steps: 1) classification adaptation and 2) detection adaptation. In classification adaptation, we transfer a pre-trained network to a multi-label classification task for recognizing the presence of a certain object in an image. Through the classification adaptation step, the network learns discriminative representations that are specific to object categories of interest. In detection adaptation, we mine class-specific object proposals by exploiting two scoring strategies based on the adapted classification network. Class-specific proposal mining helps remove substantial noise from the background clutter and potential confusion from similar objects. We further refine these proposals using multiple instance learning and segmentation cues. Using these refined object bounding boxes, we fine-tune all the layer of the classification network and obtain a fully adapted detection network. We present detailed experimental validation on the PASCAL VOC and ILSVRC datasets.

This task, however, is very challenging since manual segmentation is prohibitively timeconsuming, expensive, and requires professional knowledge. Current practices rely on an imprecise substitute called response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). Although these markers lack detailed information about the lesion regions, they are commonly found in hospitals’ picture archiving and communication systems (PACS). Thus, these markers have the potential to serve as a powerful source of weak-supervision for 2D lesion segmentation. To approach this problem, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) based weakly-supervised lesion segmentation method, which first generates the initial lesion masks from the RECIST measurements and then utilizes co-segmentation to leverage lesion similarities and refine the initial masks. In this work, an attention-based co-segmentation model is adopted due to its ability to learn more discriminative features from a pair of images.

We formulate WSSS as a novel group-wise learning task that explicitly models semantic dependencies in a group of images to estimate more reliable pseudo ground-truths, which can be used for training more accurate segmentation models. In particular, we devise a graph neural network (GNN) for group-wise semantic mining, wherein input images are represented as graph nodes, and the underlying relations between a pair of images are characterized by an efficient co-attention mechanism. Moreover, in order to prevent the model from paying excessive attention to common semantics only, we further propose a graph dropout layer, encouraging the model to learn more accurate and complete object responses. The whole network is end-to-end trainable by iterative message passing, which propagates interaction cues over the images to progressively improve the performance. We conduct experiments on the popular PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO benchmarks, and our model yields state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at: this https URL."

Existing 3D object detectors heavily rely on annotated 3D bounding boxes during training, while these annotations could be expensive to obtain and only accessible in limited scenarios. Weakly supervised learning is a promising approach to reducing the annotation requirement, but existing weakly supervised object detectors are mostly for 2D detection rather than 3D. In this work, we propose VS3D, a framework for weakly supervised 3D object detection from point clouds without using any ground truth 3D bounding box for training. First, we introduce an unsupervised 3D proposal module that generates object proposals by leveraging normalized point cloud densities. Second, we present a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy, where a convolutional neural network learns to predict the final results from the 3D object proposals by querying a teacher network pretrained on image datasets.

Existing approaches using multiple instance learning easily fall into local optima, because such mechanism tends to learn from the most discriminative object in an image for each category. Therefore, these methods suffer from missing object instances which degrade the performance of WSOD. To address this problem, this paper introduces an end-to-end object instance mining (OIM) framework for weakly supervised object detection. OIM attempts to detect all possible object instances existing in each image by introducing information propagation on the spatial and appearance graphs, without any additional annotations. During the iterative learning process, the less discriminative object instances from the same class can be gradually detected and utilized for training. In addition, we design an object instance reweighted loss to learn larger portion of each object instance to further improve the performance. The experimental results on two publicly available databases, VOC 2007 and 2012, demonstrate the efficacy of proposed approach."

This work proposes a weakly supervised approach for 3D object detection, only requiring a small set of weakly annotated scenes, associated with a few precisely labeled object instances. This is achieved by a two-stage architecture design. Stage-1 learns to generate cylindrical object proposals under weak supervision, i.e., only the horizontal centers of objects are click-annotated on bird's view scenes. Stage-2 learns to refine the cylindrical proposals to get cuboids and confidence scores, using a few well-labeled object instances. Using only 500 weakly annotated scenes and 534 precisely labeled vehicle instances, our method achieves 85-95% the performance of current top-leading, fully supervised detectors (which require 3, 712 exhaustively and precisely annotated scenes with 15, 654 instances). More importantly, with our elaborately designed network architecture, our trained model can be applied as a 3D object annotator, allowing both automatic and active working modes. The annotations generated by our model can be used to train 3D object detectors with over 94% of their original performance (under manually labeled data). Our experiments also show our model's potential in boosting performance given more training data. Above designs make our approach highly practical and introduce new opportunities for learning 3D object detection with reduced annotation burden."

We take a step from segmentation-free single line recognition towards segmentation-free multi-line / full page recognition. We propose a novel and simple neural network module, termed OrigamiNet, that can augment any CTC-trained, fully convolutional single line text recognizer, to convert it into a multi-line version by providing the model with enough spatial capacity to be able to properly collapse a 2D input signal into 1D without losing information.

To alleviate the burden on the annotator, we propose a novel weakly supervised training framework that learns from noisy pseudo labels generated from automatic vessel enhancement, rather than accurate labels obtained by fully manual annotation. A typical self-paced learning scheme is used to make the training process robust against label noise while challenged by the systematic biases in pseudo labels, thus leading to the decreased performance of CNNs at test time. To solve this problem, we propose an annotation-refining self-paced learning framework (AR-SPL) to correct the potential errors using suggestive annotation. An elaborate model-vesselness uncertainty estimation is also proposed to enable the minimal annotation cost for suggestive annotation, based on not only the CNNs in training but also the geometric features of coronary arteries derived directly from raw data. Experiments show that our proposed framework achieves 1) comparable accuracy to fully supervised learning, which also significantly outperforms other weakly supervised learning frameworks; 2) largely reduced annotation cost, i.e., 75.18% of annotation time is saved, and only 3.46% of image regions are required to be annotated; and 3) an efficient intervention process, leading to superior performance with even fewer manual interactions."

To overcome these challenges, we propose a general Weakly-Supervised framework with a Wise Selection of training samples and model evaluation criterion (WS^2). Instead of blindly trusting quality-inconsistent PAs, WS^2 employs a learning-based selection to select effective PAs and a novel region integrity criterion as a stopping condition for weakly-supervised training.

However, they overlook an essential fact that background frames could be dynamic and inconsistent. Accordingly, we cast the problem of identifying background frames as out-of-distribution detection and isolate it from conventional action classification. Beyond our base action localization network, we propose a module to estimate the probability of being background (i.e., uncertainty [20]), which allows us to learn uncertainty given only video-level labels via multiple instance learning. A background entropy loss is further designed to reject background frames by forcing them to have uniform probability distribution for action classes.

Particularly, two kinds of constraints are proposed to prompt the consistency of object features within the same categories. The first constraint is to learn the stochastic feature consistency among discriminative pixels that are randomly sampled from different images within a batch. The discriminative information embedded in one image can be leveraged to benefit its counterpart with inter-image communication. The second constraint is to learn the global consistency of object features throughout the entire dataset. We learn a feature center for each category and realize the global feature consistency by forcing the object features to approach class-specific centers. The global centers are actively updated with the training process. The two constraints can benefit each other to learn consistent pixel-level features within the same categories, and finally improve the quality of localization maps.

We present results comparable to recent fully- and weakly-supervised methods on three diverse and challenging datasets: HICO-DET for human-object interaction, Visual Relationship Detection for generic object-to-object relations, and UnRel for unusual triplets; demonstrating robustness to non-comprehensive annotations and good few-shot generalization."

People spend significant amount of time every day on emails to exchange information, manage tasks and schedule events. Previous work has studied different ways for improving email productivity by prioritizing emails, suggesting automatic replies or identifying intents to recommend appropriate actions. The problem has been mostly posed as a supervised learning problem where models of different complexities were proposed to classify an email message into a predefined taxonomy of intents or classes. The need for labeled data has always been one of the largest bottlenecks in training supervised models. This is especially the case for many real-world tasks, such as email intent classification, where large scale annotated examples are either hard to acquire or unavailable due to privacy or data access constraints. Email users often take actions in response to intents expressed in an email (e.g., setting up a meeting in response to an email with a scheduling request). Such actions can be inferred from user interaction logs. In this paper, we propose to leverage user actions as a source of weak supervision, in addition to a limited set of annotated examples, to detect intents in emails. We develop an end-to-end robust deep neural network model for email intent identification that leverages both clean annotated data and noisy weak supervision along with a self-paced learning mechanism. Extensive experiments on three different intent detection tasks show that our approach can effectively leverage the weakly supervised data to improve intent detection in emails."

For class-agnostic object localization, we should use class-agnostic methods to generate noisy pseudo annotations and then perform bounding box regression on them without class labels. We propose the pseudo supervised object localization (PSOL) method as a new way to solve WSOL. Our PSOL models have good transferability across different datasets without fine-tuning.

Learning is shown to be successful in a few segmentation settings, including pixel-level, scribbles and bounding boxes. These methods can be classified as “strongly labelled” support images because significant image editing efforts are required to provide the labeling. This paper takes another approach, i.e., only requiring image-level classification data for few-shot object segmentation. The large amount of image-level labelled data signifies this approach, if successful. The problem is challenging because there is no obvious features that can be used for segmentation in the imagelevel data. We propose a novel multi-modal interaction module for few-shot object segmentation that utilizes a co-attention mechanism using both visual and word embedding. Our model using image-level labels achieves 4.8% improvement over previously proposed image-level few-shot object segmentation. It also outperforms state-of-theart methods that use weak bounding box supervision on PASCAL-5. Our results show that fewshot segmentation benefits from utilizing word embeddings, and that we are able to perform fewshot segmentation using stacked joint visual semantic processing with weak image-level labels. We further propose a novel setup, Temporal Object Segmentation for Few-shot Learning (TOSFL) for videos. TOSFL requires only image-level labels for the first frame in order to segment objects in the following frames. TOSFL provides a novel benchmark for video segmentation, which can be used on a variety of public video data such as YoutubeVOS, as demonstrated in our experiment."

Current automatic (multi-) atlas-based segmentation strategies often lack accuracy on difficult-to-segment brain structures and, since these methods rely on atlas-to-scan alignment, they may take long processing times. Alternatively, recent methods deploying solutions based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are enabling the direct analysis of out-of-the-scanner data. However, current CNN-based solutions partition the test volume into 2D or 3D patches, which are processed independently. This process entails a loss of global contextual information, thereby negatively impacting the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we design and test an optimised end-to-end CNN architecture that makes the exploitation of global spatial information computationally tractable, allowing to process a whole MRI volume at once. We adopt a weakly supervised learning strategy by exploiting a large dataset composed of 947 out-of-the-scanner (3 Tesla T1-weighted 1mm isotropic MP-RAGE 3D sequences) MR Images. The resulting model is able to produce accurate multi-structure segmentation results in only a few seconds.

To more effectively utilize the source dataset, we propose to iteratively transfer the knowledge from the source domain by a one-class universal detector and learn the target-domain detector. The box-level pseudo ground truths mined by the target-domain detector in each iteration effectively improve the one-class universal detector. Therefore, the knowledge in the source dataset is more thoroughly exploited and leveraged. Extensive experiments are conducted with Pascal VOC 2007 as the target weakly-annotated dataset and COCO/ImageNet as the source fully-annotated dataset. With the proposed solution, we achieved an mAP of $59.7\%$ detection performance on the VOC test set and an mAP of $60.2\%$ after retraining a fully supervised Faster RCNN with the mined pseudo ground truths.

Next, the artificial dataset is applied to a deep learning recognition algorithm, and an initial model is trained. Then, the collected actual defects are augmented due to the insufficient training quantity. The augmented actual defects are then applied as the training data, and the initial model is retrained by fine tuning. Finally, the well-retrained model is used for defect recognition.

We propose a classification module to generate action labels for each segment in the video, and a deep metric learning module to learn the similarity between different action instances. We jointly optimize a balanced binary cross-entropy loss and a metric loss using a standard backpropagation algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both of these components in temporal localization.

To tackle above issues, we propose a new weakly-supervised lesions transfer framework, which can not only explore transferable domain-invariant knowledge across different datasets, but also prevent the negative transfer of untransferable representations. Specifically, a Wasserstein quantified transferability framework is developed to highlight widerange transferable contextual dependencies, while neglecting the irrelevant semantic characterizations. Moreover, a novel selfsupervised pseudo label generator is designed to equally provide confident pseudo pixel labels for both hard-to-transfer and easyto-transfer target samples. It inhibits the enormous deviation of false pseudo pixel labels under the self-supervision manner. Afterwards, dynamically-searched feature centroids are aligned to narrow category-wise distribution shift.

Given global image labels, WSL methods yield pixel-level predictions (segmentations). Despite their recent success, mostly with natural images, such methods could be seriously challenged when the foreground and background regions have similar visual cues, yielding high false-positive rates in segmentations, as is the case of challenging histology images. WSL training is commonly driven by standard classification losses, which implicitly maximize model confidence and find the discriminative regions linked to classification decisions. Therefore, they lack mechanisms for modeling explicitly non-discriminative regions and reducing false-positive rates. We propose new regularization terms, which enable the model to seek both non-discriminative and discriminative regions, while discouraging unbalanced segmentations. We introduce high uncertainty as a criterion to localize non-discriminative regions that do not affect classifier decision, and describe it with original Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence losses evaluating the deviation of posterior predictions from the uniform distribution. Our KL terms encourage high uncertainty of the model when the latter takes the latent non-discriminative regions as input. Our loss integrates: (i) a cross-entropy seeking a foreground, where model confidence about class prediction is high; (ii) a KL regularizer seeking a background, where model uncertainty is high; and (iii) log-barrier terms discouraging unbalanced segmentations. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies over the public GlaS colon cancer data show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art WSL methods, and confirm the effect of our new regularizers.

We propose a deep visualization method to generate interpretability of DL classification tasks in medical imaging by means of visual evidence augmentation. The proposed method iteratively unveils abnormalities based on the prediction of a classifier trained only with image-level labels. For each image, initial visual evidence of the prediction is extracted with a given visual attribution technique. This provides localization of abnormalities that are then removed through selective inpainting. We iteratively apply this procedure until the system considers the image as normal. This yields augmented visual evidence, including less discriminative lesions which were not detected at first but should be considered for final diagnosis. We apply the method to grading of two retinal diseases in color fundus images: diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We evaluate the generated visual evidence and the performance of weakly-supervised localization of different types of DR and AMD abnormalities, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We show that the augmented visual evidence of the predictions highlights the biomarkers considered by experts for diagnosis and improves the final localization performance. It results in a relative increase of 11.2± 2.0% per image regarding sensitivity averaged at 10 false positives/image on average, when applied to different classification tasks, visual attribution techniques and network architectures.

In this paper, we present a neural network architecture that is capable of amodal perception, when weakly supervised with standard (inmodal) bounding box annotations. Our model extends compositional convolutional neural networks (CompositionalNets), which have been shown to be robust to partial occlusion by explicitly representing objects as composition of parts. In particular, we extend CompositionalNets by: 1) Expanding the innate part-voting mechanism in the CompositionalNets to perform instance segmentation; 2) and by exploiting the internal representations of CompositionalNets to enable amodal completion for both bounding box and segmentation mask.

For VMR, several methods that require full supervision for training have been proposed. Unfortunately, acquiring a large number of training videos with labeled temporal boundaries for each query is a labor-intensive process. This paper explores methods for performing VMR in a weakly-supervised manner (wVMR): training is performed without temporal moment labels but only with the text query that describes a segment of the video. Existing methods on wVMR generate multi-scale proposals and apply query-guided attention mechanisms to highlight the most relevant proposal. To leverage the weak supervision, contrastive learning is used which predicts higher scores for the correct video-query pairs than for the incorrect pairs. It has been observed that a large number of candidate proposals, coarse query representation, and one-way attention mechanism lead to blurry attention maps which limit the localization performance. To handle this issue, Video-Language Alignment Network (VLANet) is proposed that learns sharper attention by pruning out spurious candidate proposals and applying a multi-directional attention mechanism with fine-grained query representation. The Surrogate Proposal Selection module selects a proposal based on the proximity to the query in the joint embedding space, and thus substantially reduces candidate proposals which leads to lower computation load and sharper attention. Next, the Cascaded Cross-modal Attention module considers dense feature interactions and multi-directional attention flow to learn the multi-modal alignment.

To overcome the challenge of collecting pixel-level ground truth data mostly used during training, we only assume image-level labels, representing either destruction is present (at any location) in a given image or not. The proposed attention-based mechanism learns to identify the image-patches with destruction automatically under the sparsity constraint.

Then, background frames can be detected by estimating the probability of each frame being out-of-distribution, known as uncertainty, but it is infeasible to directly learn uncertainty without frame-level labels. To realize the uncertainty learning in the weakly-supervised setting, we leverage the multiple instance learning formulation. Moreover, we further introduce a background entropy loss to better discriminate background frames by encouraging their in-distribution (action) probabilities to be uniformly distributed over all action classes. Experimental results show that our uncertainty modeling is effective at alleviating the interference of background frames and brings a large performance gain without bells and whistles. We demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmarks, THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet (1.2 & 1.3).

Many data generation methods have improved the performance of FSL models, but require lots of annotated images to train a specialized network (e.g., GAN) dedicated to hallucinate new samples. We argue that localization is a more efficient approach because it provides the most discriminative regions without using extra samples. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address the FSL task by achieving weakly-supervised object localization within performing few-shot classification. To this end, we design (i) a triplet-input module to obtain the initial object seeds and (ii) an Image-To-Class-Distance (ITCD) based localizer to activate the deep descriptors of the key objects, thus obtaining the more discriminative representations used to perform few-shot classification. Extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets under various settings. Besides, our method achieves superior performance over previous methods when training the model on miniImageNet and evaluating it on the different datasets (e.g., Stanford Dogs), demonstrating its superior generalization capacity.

A 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) is utilized to model pathological changes (e.g., atherosclerotic plaques) in coronary vessels. The system learns the discriminatory features between vessels with and without atherosclerosis. The discriminative features at the final convolutional layer are visualized with a saliency map approach to provide visual clues related to atherosclerosis likelihood and location. We have evaluated the system on a reference dataset representing 247 patients with atherosclerosis and 246 patients free of atherosclerosis.

In this paper, we propose to automate the response measurement through video recording of the scene following the use of Deep Neural models for human action recognition from videos. However, supervised learning of neural networks demand large amounts of annotated data that are hard to come by. This issue is addressed by leveraging the `similarities' between the action categories in publicly available large-scale video action (source) datasets and the dataset of interest. A technique called guided weak supervision is proposed, where every class in the target data is matched to a class in the source data using the principle of posterior likelihood maximization. Subsequently, classifier on the target data is re-trained by augmenting samples from the matched source classes, along with a new loss encouraging inter-class separability. The proposed method is evaluated on two skill assessment autism datasets, SSBD and a real world Autism dataset comprising 37 children of different ages and ethnicity who are diagnosed with autism. Our proposed method is found to improve the performance of the state-of-the-art multi-class human action recognition models in-spite of supervision with scarce data."

One possible bottleneck is that speech in the wild contains unpredictable noise types, hence frame-level label prediction is difficult, which is required for traditional supervised VAD training. In contrast, we propose a general-purpose VAD (GPVAD) framework, which can be easily trained from noisy data in a weakly supervised fashion, requiring only clip-level labels. We proposed two GPVAD models, one full (GPV-F), trained on 527 Audioset sound events, and one binary (GPV-B), only distinguishing speech and noise. We evaluate the two GPV models against a CRNN based standard VAD model (VAD-C) on three different evaluation protocols (clean, synthetic noise, real data). Results show that our proposed GPV-F demonstrates competitive performance in clean and synthetic scenarios compared to traditional VAD-C. Further, in real-world evaluation, GPV-F largely outperforms VAD-C in terms of frame-level evaluation metrics as well as segment-level ones.

In this work, we investigate how weakly-supervised learning can cope with these problems. We compare several techniques for weakly-supervised learning in detection pipelines to reduce model (re)training costs without compromising accuracy. In particular, we show that diversity sampling for constructing active learning queries and strong positives selection for selfsupervised learning enable significant annotation savings and improve domain shift adaptation.

Yet, it remains unsatisfactory for the weakly-supervised temporal action localization, where only video-level action labels are given without the timestamp annotation on when the actions occur. The main reason comes from that, the weakly-supervised networks only focus on the highly discriminative frames, but there are some ambiguous frames in both background and action classes. The ambiguous frames in background class are very similar to the real actions, which may be treated as target actions and result in false positives. On the other hand, the ambiguous frames in action class which possibly contain action instances, are prone to be false negatives by the weakly-supervised networks and result in a coarse localization. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel weakly-supervised Action Completeness Modeling with Background Aware Networks (ACM-BANets). Our Background Aware Network (BANet) contains a weight-sharing two-branch architecture, with an action guided Background aware Temporal Attention Module (B-TAM) and an asymmetrical training strategy, to suppress both highly discriminative and ambiguous background frames to remove the false positives. Our action completeness modeling contains multiple BANets, and the BANets are forced to discover different but complementary action instances to completely localize the action instances in both highly discriminative and ambiguous action frames. In the i-th iteration, the i-th BANet discovers the discriminative features, which are then erased from the feature map. The partially-erased feature map is fed into the (i+1)-th BANet of the next iteration to force this BANet to discover discriminative features different from the i-th BANet. Evaluated on two challenging untrimmed video datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3, our approach outperforms all the current weakly-supervised methods for temporal action localization."

However, the performance gap between weakly supervised and fully supervised salient object detection methods is huge, and most previous weakly supervised works adopt complex training methods with many bells and whistles. In this work, we propose a one-round end-to-end training approach for weakly supervised salient object detection via scribble annotations without pre/post-processing operations or extra supervision data. Since scribble labels fail to offer detailed salient regions, we propose a local coherence loss to propagate the labels to unlabeled regions based on image features and pixel distance, so as to predict integral salient regions with complete object structures. We design a saliency structure consistency loss as self-consistent mechanism to ensure consistent saliency maps are predicted with different scales of the same image as input, which could be viewed as a regularization technique to enhance the model generalization ability.

Due to the lack of ground truth bounding boxes, class labels are mainly employed to train the model. This model generates a class activation map (CAM) which activates the most discriminate features. However, the main drawback of CAM is the ability to detect just a part of the object. To solve this problem, some researchers have removed parts from the detected object [1, 2, 3], or the image [4]. The aim of removing parts from image or detected parts of the object is to force the model to detect the other features. However, these methods require one or many hyperparameters to erase the appropriate pixels on the image, which could involve a loss of information. In contrast, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Complementary Learning Network method (HCLNet) that helps the CNN to perform better classification and localization of objects on the images.

Recent advancements in the weakly-supervised setting show that reasonable performance can be obtained by using only image-level labels. Classification is often used as a proxy task to train a deep neural network from which attention maps are extracted. However, the classification task needs only the minimum evidence to make predictions, hence it focuses on the most discriminative object regions. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel formulation of adversarial erasing of the attention maps. In contrast to previous adversarial erasing methods, we optimize two networks with opposing loss functions, which eliminates the requirement of certain suboptimal strategies; for instance, having multiple training steps that complicate the training process or a weight sharing policy between networks operating on different distributions that might be suboptimal for performance. The proposed solution does not require saliency masks, instead it uses a regularization loss to prevent the attention maps from spreading to less discriminative object regions. Our experiments on the Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that our adversarial approach increases segmentation performance by 2.1 mIoU compared to our baseline and by 1.0 mIoU compared to previous adversarial erasing approaches."

However, most of these approaches require a combination of changed and unchanged image pairs for training. Thus, these methods can not directly be used for datasets where only changed image pairs are available. We present W-CDNet, a novel weakly supervised change detection network that can be trained with image-level semantic labels. Additionally, W-CDNet can be trained with two different types of datasets, either containing changed image pairs only or a mixture of changed and unchanged image pairs. Since we use image-level semantic labels for training, we simultaneously create a change mask and label the changed object for single-label images. W-CDNet employs a W-shaped siamese U-net to extract feature maps from an image pair which then get compared in order to create a raw change mask. The core part of our model, the Change Segmentation and Classification (CSC) module, learns an accurate change mask at a hidden layer by using a custom Remapping Block and then segmenting the current input image with the change mask. The segmented image is used to predict the image-level semantic label. The correct label can only be predicted if the change mask actually marks relevant change. This forces the model to learn an accurate change mask.

Manual methods that rely on physical tools like rulers are time and labour intensive. Leading automatic approaches rely on fully-supervised segmentation models to acquire these measurements but these require collecting per-pixel labels -- also time consuming and laborious: i.e., it can take up to two minutes per fish to generate accurate segmentation labels, almost always requiring at least some manual intervention. We propose an automatic segmentation model efficiently trained on images labeled with only point-level supervision, where each fish is annotated with a single click. This labeling process requires significantly less manual intervention, averaging roughly one second per fish. Our approach uses a fully convolutional neural network with one branch that outputs per-pixel scores and another that outputs an affinity matrix. We aggregate these two outputs using a random walk to obtain the final, refined per-pixel segmentation output. We train the entire model end-to-end with an LCFCN loss, resulting in our A-LCFCN method. We validate our model on the DeepFish dataset, which contains many fish habitats from the north-eastern Australian region.

In this paper, we present the first weakly-supervised approach to the SID problem. Although weak supervision has been considered in general saliency detection, it is mainly based on using class labels for object localization. However, it is non-trivial to use only class labels to learn instance-aware saliency information, as salient instances with high semantic affinities may not be easily separated by the labels. We note that subitizing information provides an instant judgement on the number of salient items, which naturally relates to detecting salient instances and may help separate instances of the same class while grouping different parts of the same instance. Inspired by this insight, we propose to use class and subitizing labels as weak supervision for the SID problem. We propose a novel weakly-supervised network with three branches: a Saliency Detection Branch leveraging class consistency information to locate candidate objects; a Boundary Detection Branch exploiting class discrepancy information to delineate object boundaries; and a Centroid Detection Branch using subitizing information to detect salient instance centroids. This complementary information is further fused to produce salient instance maps. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method plays favorably against carefully designed baseline methods adapted from related tasks."

In this paper, we consider the background as an important cue that guides the feature activation to cover the sophisticated object region and propose contrastive attention loss. The loss promotes similarity between foreground and its dropped version, and, dissimilarity between the dropped version and background. Furthermore, we propose foreground consistency loss that penalizes earlier layers producing noisy attention regarding the later layer as a reference to provide them with a sense of backgroundness. It guides the early layers to activate on objects rather than locally distinctive backgrounds so that their attentions to be similar to the later layer. For better optimizing the above losses, we use the non-local attention blocks to replace channel-pooled attention leading to enhanced attention maps considering the spatial similarity.

To address this problem, we proposed a weakly supervised registration-based framework for the precise prostate segmentation, by combining convolutional neural network (CNN) with statistical shape model (SSM). To obtain the prostate region, an inception-based neural network (SSM-Net) was firstly exploited to predict the model transform, shape control parameters and a fine-tuning vector, for the generation of prostate boundary. According to the inferred boundary, a normalized distance map was calculated. Then, a residual U-net (ResU-Net) was employed to predict a probability label map from the input images. Finally, the average of the distance map and the probability map was regarded as the prostate segmentation. After that, two public dataset PROMISE12 and NCI- ISBI 2013 were utilized for the model computation and for the network training and testing. The validation results demonstrate that the segmentation framework using a SSM with 9500 nodes achieved the best performance, with a dice of 0.904 and an average surface distance of 1.88 mm. In addition, we verified the impact of model elasticity augmentation and fine-tuning item on the network segmentation capability. As a result, both factors have improved the delineation accuracy, with dice increased by 10% and 7% respectively. In conclusion, via the combination of two weakly supervised neural networks, our segmentation method might be an effective and robust approach for prostate segmentation."

Coming up with such labels, especially in domains that require an expert to do annotations, comes at a heavy cost in time and money. Several methods have shown that we can learn semantic segmentation from less expensive image-level labels, but the effectiveness of point level labels, a healthy compromise between all pixels labelled and none, still remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a novel procedure for producing semantic segmentation from images given some point level annotations. This method includes point annotations in the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for producing improved localization and class activation maps. Then, we use another CNN for predicting semantic affinities in order to propagate rough class labels and create pseudo semantic segmentation labels. Finally, we propose training a CNN that is normally fully supervised using our pseudo labels in place of ground truth labels, which further improves performance and simplifies the inference process by requiring just one CNN during inference rather than two. Our method achieves state of the art results for point supervised semantic segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset \cite{everingham2010pascal}, even outperforming state of the art methods for stronger bounding box and squiggle supervision."

However, these strategies rely on full localization supervision for validating hyperparameters and model selection, which is in principle prohibited under the WSOL setup. In this paper, we argue that WSOL task is ill-posed with only image-level labels, and propose a new evaluation protocol where full supervision is limited to only a small held-out set not overlapping with the test set. We observe that, under our protocol, the five most recent WSOL methods have not made a major improvement over the CAM baseline. Moreover, we report that existing WSOL methods have not reached the few-shot learning baseline, where the full-supervision at validation time is used for model training instead. Based on our findings, we discuss some future directions for WSOL."

Previous methods rely on tedious annotations of temporal action boundaries for model training, which hinders the scalability of online action detection systems.

WOAD contains two jointly-trained modules, i.e., temporal proposal generator (TPG) and online action recognizer (OAR). Supervised by video-class labels, TPG works offline and targets on accurately mining pseudo frame-level labels for OAR. With the supervisory signals from TPG, OAR learns to conduct action detection in an online fashion. Experimental results on THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet1.2 show that our weakly-supervised method achieves competitive performance compared to previous strongly-supervised methods. Beyond that, our method is flexible to leverage strong supervision when it is available.

In this paper, a hierarchical attention network is proposed to solve a weakly labelled speaker identification problem. The use of a hierarchical structure, consisting of a frame-level encoder and a segment-level encoder, aims to learn speaker related information locally and globally. Speech streams are segmented into fragments. The frame-level encoder with attention learns features and highlights the target related frames locally, and output a fragment based embedding. The segment-level encoder works with a second attention layer to emphasize the fragments probably related to target speakers. The global information is finally collected from segment-level module to predict speakers via a classifier. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, artificial datasets based on Switchboard Cellular part1 (SWBC) and Voxceleb1 are constructed in two conditions, where speakers' voices are overlapped and not overlapped. Comparing to two baselines the obtained results show that the proposed approach can achieve better performances. Moreover, further experiments are conducted to evaluate the impact of utterance segmentation. The results show that a reasonable segmentation can slightly improve identification performances."

The emergence of deep learning leads to a recent shift in the research of HAR, which requires massive strictly labeled data. In comparison with video data, activity data recorded from accelerometer or gyroscope is often more difficult to interpret and segment. Recently, several attention mechanisms are proposed to handle the weakly labeled human activity data, which do not require accurate data annotation. However, these attention-based models can only handle the weakly labeled dataset whose sample includes one target activity, as a result it limits efficiency and practicality. In the paper, we propose a recurrent attention networks (RAN) to handle sequential weakly labeled multi-activity recognition and location tasks. The model can repeatedly perform steps of attention on multiple activities of one sample and each step is corresponding to the current focused activity. The effectiveness of the RAN model is validated on a collected sequential weakly labeled multi-activity dataset and the other two public datasets. The experiment results show that our RAN model can simultaneously infer multi-activity types from the coarse-grained sequential weak labels and determine specific locations of every target activity with only knowledge of which types of activities contained in the long sequence. It will greatly reduce the burden of manual labeling."

Nevertheless, a main drawback of deep models is that they require a large amount of pixel-level labels, which are laborious and expensive to obtain. To mitigate this problem, weakly supervised learning has emerged as an efficient alternative, which employs image-level labels, scribbles, points, or bounding boxes as supervision. Among these, image-level labels are easier to obtain. However, since this type of annotation only contains object category information, the segmentation task under this learning paradigm is a challenging problem. To address this issue, visual salient regions derived from trained classification networks are typically used. Despite their success to identify important regions on classification tasks, these saliency regions only focus on the most discriminant areas of an image, limiting their use in semantic segmentation. In this work, we propose a manifold driven attention-based network to enhance visual salient regions, thereby improving segmentation accuracy in a weakly supervised setting. Our method generates superior attention maps directly during inference without the need of extra computations. We evaluate the benefits of our approach in the task of segmentation using a public benchmark on skin lesion images.

In this paper, we propose an approach that utilises transcripts without bounding box annotations to train segmentation-free query-by-string word spotting models, given a partially trained model. This is done through a training-free alignment procedure based on hidden Markov models. This procedure creates a tentative mapping between word region proposals and the transcriptions to automatically create additional weakly annotated training data, without choosing any single alignment possibility as the correct one. When only using between 1% and 10% of the fully annotated training sets for partial convergence, we automatically annotate the remaining training data and achieve successful training using it. In terms of mean average precision, our final trained model then comes within a few percent of the performance of a model trained with the full training set on all our datasets. We believe that this will be a significant advance towards a more general use of word spotting, since digital transcription data will already exist for parts of many collections of interest."

In this paper, we present a novel approach to locate different type of lesions in positron emission tomography (PET) images using only a class label at the image-level. First, a simple convolutional neural network classifier is trained to predict the type of cancer on two 2D MIP images. Then, a pseudo-localization of the tumor is generated using class activation maps, back-propagated and corrected in a multitask learning approach with prior knowledge, resulting in a tumor detection mask. Finally, we use the mask generated from the two 2D images to detect the tumor in the 3D image. The advantage of our proposed method consists of detecting the whole tumor volume in 3D images, using only two 2D images of PET image, and showing a very promising results.

Through this head, the backbone is meta-trained using only image-level labels to produce good features for jointly localizing and classifying previously unseen categories of few-shot test tasks using a star-model that geometrically matches between the query and support images (to find corresponding object instances).

The proposed approach intends to show the usefulness of every layer termed as global-local attention in 3D CNN via visual attribution, weakly-supervised action localization, and action recognition. Firstly, the 3DResNext is trained and applied for action classification using backpropagation concerning the maximum predicted class. The gradients and activations of every layer are then up-sampled. Later, aggregation is used to produce more nuanced attention, which points out the most critical part of the predicted class's input videos. We use contour thresholding of final attention for final localization. We evaluate spatial and temporal action localization in trimmed videos using fine-grained visual explanation via 3DCam.

Our main contribution is the introduction of a novel loss formulation, which jointly enhances the discriminability of latent embeddings and robustness of the output temporal class activations with respect to foreground-background noise caused by weak supervision. The proposed formulation comprises a discriminative and a denoising loss term for enhancing temporal action localization. The discriminative term incorporates a classification loss and utilizes a top-down attention mechanism to enhance the separability of latent foreground-background embeddings. The denoising loss term explicitly addresses the foreground-background noise in class activations by simultaneously maximizing intra-video and inter-video mutual information using a bottom-up attention mechanism. As a result, activations in the foreground regions are emphasized whereas those in the background regions are suppressed, thereby leading to more robust predictions.

However, most of the existing large ECG datasets are roughly annotated, so the classification model trained on them can only detect the existence of abnormalities in a whole recording, but cannot determine their exact occurrence time. In addition, it may take huge time and economic cost to construct a fine-annotated ECG dataset. Therefore, this study proposes weakly supervised deep learning models for detecting abnormal ECG events and their occurrence time. The available supervision information for the models is limited to the event types in an ECG record, excluding the specific occurring time of each event. By leverage of feature locality of deep convolution neural network, the models first make predictions based on the local features, and then aggregate the local predictions to infer the existence of each event during the whole record. Through training, the local predictions are expected to reflect the specific occurring time of each event. To test their potentials, we apply the models for detecting cardiac rhythmic and morphological arrhythmias by using the AFDB and MITDB datasets, respectively. The results show that the models achieve beat-level accuracies of 99.09% in detecting atrial fibrillation, and 99.13% in detecting morphological arrhythmias, which are comparable to that of fully supervised learning models, demonstrating their effectiveness.

This term induces a clustering of the image pixels in the object classes under consideration, whose aim is to improve the training of the segmentation network by guiding the optimization. The performance of the approach is evaluated against datasets from two different industry-related case studies: while one involves the detection of instances of a number of different object classes in the context of a quality control application, the other stems from the visual inspection domain and deals with the localization of images areas whose pixels correspond to scene surface points affected by a specific sort of defect. The detection results that are reported for both cases show that, despite the differences among them and the particular challenges, the use of weak annotations do not prevent from achieving a competitive performance level for both."

However, without object-level labels, WSOD detectors are prone to detect bounding boxes on salient objects, clustered objects and discriminative object parts. Moreover, the image-level category labels do not enforce consistent object detection across different transformations of the same images. To address the above issues, we propose a Comprehensive Attention Self-Distillation (CASD) training approach for WSOD. To balance feature learning among all object instances, CASD computes the comprehensive attention aggregated from multiple transformations and feature layers of the same images. To enforce consistent spatial supervision on objects, CASD conducts self-distillation on the WSOD networks, such that the comprehensive attention is approximated simultaneously by multiple transformations and feature layers of the same images. CASD produces new state-of-the-art WSOD results on standard benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 and MS-COCO."

Since the localization accuracy from CAM is constrained by the resolution of the model's feature map, one may expect that segmentation models, which generally have large feature maps, would produce more accurate CAMs. However, we have found that this is not the case due to task mismatch. While segmentation models are developed for datasets with pixel-level annotation, only image-level annotation is available in most medical imaging datasets. Our experiments suggest that Global Average Pooling (GAP) and Group Normalization are the main culprits that worsen the localization accuracy of CAM. To address this issue, we propose Pyramid Localization Network (PYLON), a model for high-accuracy weakly-supervised localization that achieved 0.62 average point localization accuracy on NIH's Chest X-Ray 14 dataset, compared to 0.45 for a traditional CAM model.

Much research turns to address the problem of how to detect both the types and the timestamps of sound events with weak labels that only specify the types. This task can be treated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, and the key to it is the design of a pooling function. In this paper, we propose an adaptive power pooling function which can automatically adapt to various sound sources. On two public datasets, the proposed power pooling function outperforms the state-of-the-art linear softmax pooling on both coarsegrained and fine-grained metrics. Notably, it improves the event-based F1 score (which evaluates the detection of event onsets and offsets) by 11.4% and 10.2% relative on the two datasets.

Currently, the state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which achieved remarkable performances in a standard Cartesian volumetric data. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer the challenges of low efficiency and GPU unfriendly image size. Therefore, such difficulties and expensive hardware requirements become a bottleneck to build accurate and efficient segmentation models for real clinical application. In this paper, we propose a novel Frustum ultrasound based catheter segmentation method. Specifically, Frustum ultrasound is a polar coordinate based image, which includes same information of standard Cartesian image but has much smaller size, which overcomes the bottleneck of efficiency than conventional Cartesian images. Nevertheless, the irregular and deformed Frustum images lead to more efforts for accurate voxel-level annotation. To address this limitation, a weakly supervised learning framework is proposed, which only needs 3D bounding box annotations overlaying the region-of-interest to training the CNNs. Although the bounding box annotation includes noise and inaccurate annotation to mislead to model, it is addressed by the proposed pseudo label generated scheme. The labels of training voxels are generated by incorporating class activation maps with line filtering, which is iteratively updated during the training. Our experimental results show the proposed method achieved the state-of-the-art performance with an efficiency of 0.25 second per volume. More crucially, the Frustum image segmentation provides a much faster and cheaper solution for segmentation in 3D US image, which meet the demands of clinical applications."

This paper examines this problem and proposes an approach which mimics the clinical practice of looking for an evidence prior to diagnosis. A CAD model is learnt using a mixed set of information: class labels for the entire training set of images plus a rough localisation of suspect regions as an extra input for a smaller subset of training images for guiding the learning. The proposed approach is illustrated with detection of diabetic macular edema (DME) from OCT slices. Results of testing on on a large public dataset show that with just a third of images with roughly segmented fluid filled regions, the classification accuracy is on par with state of the art methods while providing a good explanation in the form of anatomically accurate heatmap /region of interest.

We~also present a subsequent active learning scheme for safely assigning weakly annotated images a strong annotation using the trained model. Experimental results showed a 24\% point increase in correct localization (CorLoc) measure, which is the ratio of correctly localized and classified images, by assigning the properly controlled weight. Performing active learning after a model is trained showed an additional increase in CorLoc. We tested the proposed method on the Stanford Dog datasets to assure that it can be applied to general cases, where strong annotations are insufficient to obtain resembling results.

The existing methods can be categorized into two localization-by-classification pipelines, i.e., the pre-classification pipeline and the post-classification pipeline. The pre-classification pipeline first performs classification on each video snippet and then aggregate the snippet-level classification scores to obtain the video-level classification score, while the post-classification pipeline aggregates the snippet-level features first and then predicts the video-level classification score based on the aggregated feature. Although the classifiers in these two pipelines are used in different ways, the role they play is exactly the same---to classify the given features to identify the corresponding action categories. To this end, an ideal classifier can make both pipelines work. This inspires us to simultaneously learn these two pipelines in a unified framework to obtain an effective classifier. Specifically, in the proposed learning framework, we implement two parallel network streams to model the two localization-by-classification pipelines simultaneously and make the two network streams share the same classifier, thus achieving the novel Equivalent Classification Mapping (ECM) mechanism. Considering that an ideal classifier would make the classification results of the two network streams be identical and make the frame-level classification scores obtained from the pre-classification pipeline and the feature aggregation weights in the post-classification pipeline be consistent, we further introduce an equivalent classification loss and an equivalent weight transition module to endow the proposed learning framework with such properties.

In the imaging sciences, many applications do not have an object-background structure and bounding boxes are not available. Any available annotation typically comes from ground truth or domain experts. A direct way to train without masks is using prior knowledge on the size of objects/classes in the segmentation. We present a new algorithm to include such information via constraints on the network output, implemented via projection-based point-to-set distance functions. This type of distance functions always has the same functional form of the derivative, and avoids the need to adapt penalty functions to different constraints, as well as issues related to constraining properties typically associated with non-differentiable functions. Whereas object size information is known to enable object segmentation from bounding boxes from datasets with many general and medical images, we show that the applications extend to the imaging sciences where data represents indirect measurements, even in the case of single examples. We illustrate the capabilities in case of a) one or more classes do not have any annotation; b) there is no annotation at all; c) there are bounding boxes. We use data for hyperspectral time-lapse imaging, object segmentation in corrupted images, and sub-surface aquifer mapping from airborne-geophysical remote-sensing data. The examples verify that the developed methodology alleviates difficulties with annotating non-visual imagery for a range of experimental settings."

Early detection of PACG is essential, so as to provide timely treatment and minimize the vision loss. In the clinical practice, PACG is diagnosed by analyzing the angle between the cornea and iris with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The rapid development of deep learning technologies provides the feasibility of building a computer-aided system for the fast and accurate segmentation of cornea and iris tissues. However, the application of deep learning methods in the medical imaging field is still restricted by the lack of enough fully-annotated samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to segment the target tissues accurately for the AS-OCT images, by using the combination of weakly-annotated images (majority) and fully-annotated images (minority). The proposed framework consists of two models which provide reliable guidance for each other. In addition, uncertainty guided strategies are adopted to increase the accuracy and stability of the guidance. Detailed experiments on the publicly available AGE dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-/weakly-supervised methods and has a comparable performance as the fully-supervised method.

Built-up area estimation is an important component in understanding the human impact on the environment, effect of public policy and in general urban population analysis. The diverse nature of aerial and satellite imagery (capturing different geographical locations, terrains and weather conditions) and lack of labeled data covering this diversity makes machine learning algorithms difficult to generalize for such tasks, especially across multiple domains. Re-training for new domain is both computationally and labor expansive mainly due to the cost of collecting pixel level labels required for the segmentation task. Domain adaptation algorithms have been proposed to enable algorithms trained on images of one domain (source) to work on images from other dataset (target). Unsupervised domain adaptation is a popular choice since it allows the trained model to adapt without requiring any ground-truth information of the target domain. On the other hand, due to the lack of strong spatial context and structure, in comparison to the ground imagery, application of existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods results in the sub-optimal adaptation. We thoroughly study limitations of existing domain adaptation methods and propose a weakly-supervised adaptation strategy where we assume image level labels are available for the target domain. More specifically, we design a built-up area segmentation network (as encoder-decoder), with image classification head added to guide the adaptation. The devised system is able to address the problem of visual differences in multiple satellite and aerial imagery datasets, ranging from high resolution (HR) to very high resolution (VHR), by investigating the latent space as well as the structured output space. A realistic and challenging HR dataset is created by hand-tagging the 73.4 sq-km of Rwanda, capturing a variety of build-up structures over different terrain. The developed dataset is spatially rich compared to existing datasets and covers diverse built-up scenarios including built-up areas in forests and deserts, mud houses, tin and colored rooftops. Extensive experiments are performed by adapting from the single-source domain datasets, such as Massachusetts Buildings Dataset, to segment out the target domain.

We incorporate this segment-level supervision along with a novel localization module in the training. Specifically, we devise a partial segment loss regarded as a loss sampling to learn integral action parts from labeled segments. Since the labeled segments are only parts of actions, the model tends to overfit along with the training process. To tackle this problem, we first obtain a similarity matrix from discriminative features guided by a sphere loss. Then, a propagation loss is devised based on the matrix to act as a regularization term, allowing implicit unlabeled segments propagation during training. Experiments validate that our method can outperform the video-level supervision methods with almost same the annotation time."

Most recent methods mine the object regions by expanding the seed regions localized by class activation maps. They generally do not consider the sizes of objects and apply a monotonous procedure to mining all the object regions. Thus their mined regions are often insufficient in number and scale for large objects, and on the other hand easily contaminated by surrounding backgrounds for small objects. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-miner framework to perform a region mining process that adapts to diverse object sizes and is thus able to mine more integral and finer object regions. Specifically, our multi-miner leverages a parallel modulator to check whether there are remaining object regions for each single object, and guide a category-aware generator to mine the regions of each object independently. In this way, the multi-miner adaptively takes more steps for large objects and fewer steps for small objects. Experiment results demonstrate that the multi-miner offers better region mining results and helps achieve better segmentation performance than state-of-the-art weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods."

In this work, we argue that learning only an objectness function is a weak form of knowledge transfer and propose to learn a classwise pairwise similarity function that directly compares two input proposals as well. The combined localization model and the estimated object annotations are jointly learned in an alternating optimization paradigm as is typically done in standard WSOL methods. In contrast to the existing work that learns pairwise similarities, our proposed approach optimizes a unified objective with convergence guarantee and it is computationally efficient for large-scale applications. Experiments on the COCO and ILSVRC 2013 detection datasets show that the performance of the localization model improves significantly with the inclusion of pairwise similarity function.

MIL is gaining traction for learning from weak labels but has not been widely applied to 3D medical imaging. MIL is well-suited to clinical CT acquisitions since (1) the highly anisotropic voxels hinder application of traditional 3D networks and (2) patch-based networks have limited ability to learn whole volume labels. In this work, we apply MIL with a deep convolutional neural network to identify whether clinical CT head image volumes possess one or more large hemorrhages (> 20cm$^3$), resulting in a learned 2D model without the need for 2D slice annotations. Individual image volumes are considered separate bags, and the slices in each volume are instances.

In a weakly supervised manner, since only image-level labels are available, discriminating objects from the background is challenging, and in some cases, much more difficult. More specifically, some objects which are commonly seen in one specific scene (e.g. ""train"" typically is seen on ""railroad track"") are much more likely to be confused. In this paper, we propose a method to add the target-specific scenes in order to overcome the aforementioned problem. Actually, we propose a scene recommender which suggests to add some specific scene contexts to the target dataset in order to train the model more accurately. It is notable that this idea could be a complementary part of the baselines of many other methods. The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the objects for which the scene context is added."

This hinders the progress towards advanced video architectures. This paper presents an in-depth study of using large volumes of web videos for pre-training video models for the task of action recognition. Our primary empirical finding is that pre-training at a very large scale (over 65 million videos), despite on noisy social-media videos and hashtags, substantially improves the state-of-the-art on three challenging public action recognition datasets. Further, we examine three questions in the construction of weakly-supervised video action datasets. First, given that actions involve interactions with objects, how should one construct a verb-object pre-training label space to benefit transfer learning the most? Second, frame-based models perform quite well on action recognition; is pre-training for good image features sufficient or is pre-training for spatio-temporal features valuable for optimal transfer learning? Finally, actions are generally less well-localized in long videos vs. short videos; since action labels are provided at a video level, how should one choose video clips for best performance, given some fixed budget of number or minutes of videos?"

A common limitation for these techniques is that they cover only the most discriminative part of the object, not the entire object. To address this problem, we propose an Attention-based Dropout Layer (ADL), which utilizes the self-attention mechanism to process the feature maps of the model. The proposed method is composed of two key components: 1) hiding the most discriminative part from the model for capturing the integral extent of object, and 2) highlighting the informative region for improving the recognition power of the model. Based on extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to improve the accuracy of WSOL, achieving a new state-of-the-art localization accuracy in CUB-200-2011 dataset. We also show that the proposed method is much more efficient in terms of both parameter and computation overheads than existing techniques."

Enforcing high‐order (global) inequality constraints on the network output (for instance, to constrain the size of the target region) can leverage unlabeled data, guiding the training process with domain‐specific knowledge. Inequality constraints are very flexible because they do not assume exact prior knowledge. However, constrained Lagrangian dual optimization has been largely avoided in deep networks, mainly for computational tractability reasons. To the best of our knowledge, the method of Pathak et al. (2015a) is the only prior work that addresses deep CNNs with linear constraints in weakly supervised segmentation. It uses the constraints to synthesize fully‐labeled training masks (proposals) from weak labels, mimicking full supervision and facilitating dual optimization. We propose to introduce a differentiable penalty, which enforces inequality constraints directly in the loss function, avoiding expensive Lagrangian dual iterates and proposal generation. From constrained‐optimization perspective, our simple penalty‐based approach is not optimal as there is no guarantee that the constraints are satisfied. However, surprisingly, it yields substantially better results than the Lagrangian‐based constrained CNNs in Pathak et al. (2015a), while reducing the computational demand for training. By annotating only a small fraction of the pixels, the proposed approach can reach a level of segmentation performance that is comparable to full supervision on three separate tasks. While our experiments focused on basic linear constraints such as the target‐region size and image tags, our framework can be easily extended to other non‐linear constraints, e.g., invariant shape moments (Klodt and Cremers, 2011) and other region statistics (Lim et al., 2014). Therefore, it has the potential to close the gap between weakly and fully supervised learning in semantic medical image segmentation. Our code is publicly available."

Our approach generates pseudo instance segmentation labels of training images, which are used to train a fully supervised model.

To this end, we propose IRNet, which estimates rough areas of individual instances and detects boundaries between different object classes. It thus enables to assign instance labels to the seeds and to propagate them within the boundaries so that the entire areas of instances can be estimated accurately. Furthermore, IRNet is trained with inter-pixel relations on the attention maps, thus no extra supervision is required. Our method with IRNet achieves an outstanding performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, surpassing not only previous state-of-the-art trained with the same level of supervision, but also some of previous models relying on stronger supervision."

While for a long time human skeletons were parameterized and fitted to the observation by satisfying a reprojection error, nowadays researchers directly use neural networks to infer the 3D pose from the observations. However, most of these approaches ignore the fact that a reprojection constraint has to be satisfied and are sensitive to overfitting. We tackle the overfitting problem by ignoring 2D to 3D correspondences. This efficiently avoids a simple memorization of the training data and allows for a weakly supervised training. One part of the proposed reprojection network (RepNet) learns a mapping from a distribution of 2D poses to a distribution of 3D poses using an adversarial training approach. Another part of the network estimates the camera. This allows for the definition of a network layer that performs the reprojection of the estimated 3D pose back to 2D which results in a reprojection loss function. Our experiments show that RepNet generalizes well to unknown data and outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to unseen data. Moreover, our implementation runs in real-time on a standard desktop PC."

Training CNNs requires a large amount of labeled data, but manually annotating data is difficult. For emancipating manpower, in recent years, some synthetic datasets are released. However, they are still different from real scenes, which causes that training a model on the synthetic data (source domain) cannot achieve a good performance on real urban scenes (target domain). In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised adversarial domain adaptation to improve the segmentation performance from synthetic data to real scenes, which consists of three deep neural networks. A detection and segmentation (DS) model focuses on detecting objects and predicting segmentation map; a pixel-level domain classifier (PDC) tries to distinguish the image features from which domains; and an object-level domain classifier (ODC) discriminates the objects from which domains and predicts object classes. PDC and ODC are treated as the discriminators, and DS is considered as the generator. By the adversarial learning, DS is supposed to learn domain-invariant features.

Since bounding-box-level ground truth is not available, most of the solutions proposed so far are based on an iterative, Multiple Instance Learning framework in which the current classifier is used to select the highest-confidence boxes in each image, which are treated as pseudo-ground truth in the next training iteration. However, the errors of an immature classifier can make the process drift, usually introducing many of false positives in the training dataset. To alleviate this problem, we propose in this paper a training protocol based on the self-paced learning paradigm. The main idea is to iteratively select a subset of images and boxes that are the most reliable, and use them for training. While in the past few years similar strategies have been adopted for SVMs and other classifiers, we are the first showing that a self-paced approach can be used with deep-network-based classifiers in an end-to-end training pipeline. The method we propose is built on the fully-supervised Fast-RCNN architecture and can be applied to similar architectures which represent the input image as a bag of boxes.

In this paper, we introduce a continuation optimization method into MIL and thereby creating continuation multiple instance learning (C-MIL), with the intention of alleviating the non-convexity problem in a systematic way. We partition instances into spatially related and class related subsets, and approximate the original loss function with a series of smoothed loss functions defined within the subsets. Optimizing smoothed loss functions prevents the training procedure falling prematurely into local minima and facilitates the discovery of Stable Semantic Extremal Regions (SSERs) which indicate full object extent.

Many supervised SED algorithms rely on strongly labelled data that contains the onset and offset annotations of sound events. However, many audio tagging datasets are weakly labelled, that is, only the presence of the sound events is known, without knowing their onset and offset annotations. In this paper, we propose a time–frequency (T–F) segmentation framework trained on weakly labelled data to tackle the sound event detection and separation problem. In training, a segmentation mapping is applied on a T–F representation, such as log mel spectrogram of an audio clip to obtain T–F segmentation masks of sound events. The T–F segmentation masks can be used for separating the sound events from the background scenes in the T–F domain. Then, a classification mapping is applied on the T–F segmentation masks to estimate the presence probabilities of the sound events. We model the segmentation mapping using a convolutional neural network and the classification mapping using a global weighted rank pooling. In SED, predicted onset and offset times can be obtained from the T–F segmentation masks. As a byproduct, separated waveforms of sound events can be obtained from the T–F segmentation masks.

Next, we augment the image guided by these attention maps, including attention cropping and attention dropping. The proposed WS-DAN improves the classification accuracy in two folds. In the first stage, images can be seen better since more discriminative parts' features will be extracted.

How to make full use of the class-level and region-level supervisions from bounding boxes is the critical challenge for the weakly supervised learning task. In this paper, we first introduce a box-driven class-wise masking model (BCM) to remove irrelevant regions of each class.

Graphical abstract Figure. No Caption available. ABSTRACT Developing new deep learning methods for medical image analysis is a prevalent research topic in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a deep learning scheme with a novel loss function for weakly supervised breast cancer diagnosis. According to the Nottingham Grading System, mitotic count plays an important role in breast cancer diagnosis and grading. To determine the cancer grade, pathologists usually need to manually count mitosis from a great deal of histopathology images, which is a very tedious and time‐consuming task. This paper proposes an automatic method for detecting mitosis. We regard the mitosis detection task as a semantic segmentation problem and use a deep fully convolutional network to address it. Different from conventional training data used in semantic segmentation system, the training label of mitosis data is usually in the format of centroid pixel, rather than all the pixels belonging to a mitosis. The centroid label is a kind of weak label, which is much easier to annotate and can save the effort of pathologists a lot. However, technically this weak label is not sufficient for training a mitosis segmentation model. To tackle this problem, we expand the single‐pixel label to a novel label with concentric circles, where the inside circle is a mitotic region and the ring around the inside circle is a “middle ground”. During the training stage, we do not compute the loss of the ring region because it may have the presence of both mitotic and non‐mitotic pixels. This new loss termed as “concentric loss” is able to make the semantic segmentation network be trained with the weakly annotated mitosis data. On the generated segmentation map from the segmentation model, we filter out low confidence and obtain mitotic cells. On the challenging ICPR 2014 MITOSIS dataset and AMIDA13 dataset, we achieve a 0.562 F‐score and 0.673 F‐score respectively, outperforming all previous approaches significantly. On the latest TUPAC16 dataset, we obtain a F‐score of 0.669, which is also the state‐of‐the‐art result. The excellent results quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mitosis segmentation network with the concentric loss.

In order to learn robust models, previous methods usually assume videos are trimmed as short sequences and require ground-truth annotations of each video frame/sequence, which is quite costly and time-consuming. In this paper, given only video-level annotations, we propose a novel weakly supervised framework to simultaneously locate action frames as well as recognize actions in untrimmed videos. Our proposed framework consists of two major components. First, for action frame localization, we take advantage of the self-attention mechanism to weight each frame, such that the influence of background frames can be effectively eliminated. Second, considering that there are trimmed videos publicly available and also they contain useful information to leverage, we present an additional module to transfer the knowledge from trimmed videos for improving the classification performance in untrimmed ones. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets (i.e., THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3), and experimental results clearly corroborate the efficacy of our method."

However, the success of most current models is the result of heavy training on big data. Meta-learning addresses this problem by extracting common knowledge across different tasks that can be quickly adapted to new tasks. However, they do not fully explore weakly-supervised information, which is usually free or cheap to collect. In this paper, we show that weakly-labeled data can significantly improve the performance of meta-learning on few-shot classification. We propose prototype propagation network (PPN) trained on few-shot tasks together with data annotated by coarse-label. Given a category graph of the targeted fine-classes and some weakly-labeled coarse-classes, PPN learns an attention mechanism which propagates the prototype of one class to another on the graph, so that the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier defined on the propagated prototypes results in high accuracy across different few-shot tasks. The training tasks are generated by subgraph sampling, and the training objective is obtained by accumulating the level-wise classification loss on the subgraph. The resulting graph of prototypes can be continually re-used and updated for new tasks and classes. We also introduce two practical test/inference settings which differ according to whether the test task can leverage any weakly-supervised information as in training. On two benchmarks, PPN significantly outperforms most recent few-shot learning methods in different settings, even when they are also allowed to train on weakly-labeled data."

The fully-connected conditional random field loss is utilized to further refine the model without introducing extra computational complexity during inference.

AudioSet is weakly labelled, in that only the presence or absence of sound classes is known for each clip, whereas the onset and offset times are unknown. To address the weakly labelled audio tagging problem, we propose attention neural networks as a way to attend the most salient parts of an audio clip. We bridge the connection between attention neural networks and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods, and propose decision-level and feature-level attention neural networks for audio tagging. We investigate attention neural networks modeled by different functions, depths, and widths. Experiments on AudioSet show that the feature-level attention neural network achieves a state-of-the-art mean average precision of 0.369, outperforming the best MIL method of 0.317 and Google's deep neural network baseline of 0.314.

In the current weakly-supervised segmentation methods, the most widely adopted approach is based on visualization. However, the visualization results are not generally equal to semantic segmentation. Therefore, to perform accurate semantic segmentation under the weakly supervised condition, it is necessary to consider the mapping functions that convert the visualization results into semantic segmentation. For such mapping functions, the conditional random field and iterative re-training using the outputs of a segmentation model are usually used. However, these methods do not always guarantee improvements in accuracy; therefore, if we apply these mapping functions iteratively multiple times, eventually the accuracy will not improve or will decrease. In this paper, to make the most of such mapping functions, we assume that the results of the mapping function include noise, and we improve the accuracy by removing noise. To achieve our aim, we propose the self-supervised difference detection module, which estimates noise from the results of the mapping functions by predicting the difference between the segmentation masks before and after the mapping. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by performing experiments on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes 2012 dataset, and we achieved 64.9% in the val set and 65.5% in the test set.

In this paper, we join weakly supervised object detection and segmentation tasks with a multi-task learning scheme for the first time, which uses their respective failure patterns to complement each other's learning. Such cross-task enforcement helps both tasks to leap out of their respective local minimums. In particular, we present an efficient and effective framework termed Weakly Supervised Joint Detection and Segmentation (WS-JDS). WS-JDS has two branches for the above two tasks, which share the same backbone network. In the learning stage, it uses the same cyclic training paradigm but with a specific loss function such that the two branches benefit each other.

Without requiring temporal action boundary annotations in training data, WS-TAL could possibly exploit automatically retrieved video tags as video-level labels. However, such coarse video-level supervision inevitably incurs confusions, especially in untrimmed videos containing multiple action instances. To address this challenge, we propose the Contrast-based Localization EvaluAtioN Network (CleanNet) with our new action proposal evaluator, which provides pseudo-supervision by leveraging the temporal contrast in snippet-level action classification predictions. Essentially, the new action proposal evaluator enforces an additional temporal contrast constraint so that high-evaluation-score action proposals are more likely to coincide with true action instances. Moreover, the new action localization module is an integral part of CleanNet which enables end-to-end training. This is in contrast to many existing WS-TAL methods where action localization is merely a post-processing step. Experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet datasets validate the efficacy of CleanNet against existing state-ofthe- art WS-TAL algorithms."

Inspired by the adversarial erasing strategy in weakly supervised semantic segmentation, we propose a novel iterative-winners-out network. Specifically, we make two technical contributions: we propose an iterative training strategy, namely, winners-out, to select the most discriminative action instances in each training iteration and remove them in the next training iteration. This iterative process alleviates the “winner-takes-all” phenomenon that existing approaches tend to choose the video segments that strongly correspond to the video label but neglects other less discriminative video segments. With this strategy, our network is able to localize not only the most discriminative instances but also the less discriminative ones. To better select the target action instances in winners-out, we devise a class-discriminative localization technique. By employing the attention mechanism and the information learned from data, our technique is able to identify the most discriminative action instances effectively. The two key components are integrated into an end-to-end network to localize actions without using the frame-level annotations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches on ActivityNet1.3 and improves mAP from 16.9% to 20.5% on THUMOS14.

Existing WSAD methods detect action instances by scoring each video segment (a stack of frames) individually. Most of them fail to model the temporal relations among video segments and cannot effectively characterize action instances possessing latent temporal structure. To alleviate this problem in WSAD, we propose the temporal structure mining (TSM) approach. In TSM, each action instance is modeled as a multi-phase process and phase evolving within an action instance, \emph{i.e.}, the temporal structure, is exploited. Meanwhile, the video background is modeled by a background phase, which separates different action instances in an untrimmed video. In this framework, phase filters are used to calculate the confidence scores of the presence of an action's phases in each segment. Since in the WSAD task, frame-level annotations are not available and thus phase filters cannot be trained directly. To tackle the challenge, we treat each segment's phase as a hidden variable. We use segments' confidence scores from each phase filter to construct a table and determine hidden variables, i.e., phases of segments, by a maximal circulant path discovery along the table. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed TSM."

To alleviate this issue, we propose a marginalized average attentional network (MAAN) to suppress the dominant response of the most salient regions in a principled manner. The MAAN employs a novel marginalized average aggregation (MAA) module and learns a set of latent discriminative probabilities in an end-to-end fashion. MAA samples multiple subsets from the video snippet features according to a set of latent discriminative probabilities and takes the expectation over all the averaged subset features. Theoretically, we prove that the MAA module with learned latent discriminative probabilities successfully reduces the difference in responses between the most salient regions and the others. Therefore, MAAN is able to generate better class activation sequences and identify dense and integral action regions in the videos. Moreover, we propose a fast algorithm to reduce the complexity of constructing MAA from O(2 T) to O(T 2).

In this paper, we propose a novel WSOD framework with Objectness Distillation (i.e., WSOD2) by designing a tailored training mechanism for weakly-supervised object detection. Multiple regression targets are specifically determined by jointly considering bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) objectness from low-level measurement and CNN confidences with an adaptive linear combination. As bounding box regression can facilitate a region proposal learning to approach its regression target with high objectness during training, deep objectness representation learned from bottom-up evidences can be gradually distilled into CNN by optimization. We explore different adaptive training curves for BU/TD objectness, and show that the proposed WSOD2 can achieve state-of-the-art results."

Min-entropy serves as a model to learn object locations and a metric to measure the randomness of object localization during learning. It aims to principally reduce the variance of learned instances and alleviate the ambiguity of detectors. MELM is decomposed into three components including proposal clique partition, object clique discovery, and object localization.

The main computational challenge is the complex nature of the conditional distribution, which consists of terms over hundreds or thousands of variables. The complexity of the conditional distribution rules out the possibility of explicitly modeling it. Instead, we exploit the fact that deep learning frameworks rely on stochastic optimization. This allows us to use a state of the art discrete generative model that can provide annotation consistent samples from the conditional distribution.

However, they generally have two limitations: 1) discriminative localization relies on region proposal methods to hypothesize the locations of discriminative regions, which are time-consuming and the bottleneck of improving classification speed and 2) the training of discriminative localization depends on object or part annotations which are heavily labor-consuming and the obstacle of marching toward practical application. It is highly challenging to address the two limitations simultaneously, while existing methods only focus on one of them. Therefore, we propose a weakly supervised discriminative localization approach (WSDL) for fast fine-grained image classification to address the two limitations at the same time, and its main advantages are: 1) multi-level attention guided localization learning is proposed to localize discriminative regions with different focuses automatically, without using object and part annotations, avoiding the labor consumption. Different level attentions focus on different characteristics of the image, which are complementary and boost classification accuracy and 2) $n$ -pathway end-to-end discriminative localization network is proposed to improve classification speed, which simultaneously localizes multiple different discriminative regions for one image to boost classification accuracy, and shares full-image convolutional features generated by a region proposal network to accelerate the process of generating region proposals as well as reduce the computation of convolutional operation.

We first design a process to selectively collect pseudo supervision from noisy segment proposals obtained with previously published techniques. The pseudo supervision is used to learn a differentiable filling module that predicts a class-agnostic activation map for each instance given the image and an incomplete region response.

Unfortunately, the PXRs residing in hospital picture archiving and communication system do not typically specify region of interests. In this paper, we propose a two-stage hip and pelvic fracture detection method that executes localized fracture classification using weakly supervised ROI mining. The first stage uses a large capacity fully-convolutional network, i.e., deep with high levels of abstraction, in a multiple instance learning setting to automatically mine probable true positive and definite hard negative ROIs from the whole PXR in the training data. The second stage trains a smaller capacity model, i.e., shallower and more generalizable, with the mined ROIs to perform localized analyses to classify fractures. During inference, our method detects hip and pelvic fractures in one pass by chaining the probability outputs of the two stages together. We evaluate our method on 4 410 PXRs, reporting an area under the ROC curve value of 0.975, the highest among state-of-the-art fracture detection methods.

Most existing methods tend to solve this problem by using a two-phase learning procedure, i.e., multiple instance learning detector followed by a fully supervised learning detector with bounding-box regression. Based on our observation, this procedure may lead to local minima for some object categories. In this paper, we propose to jointly train the two phases in an end-to-end manner to tackle this problem. Specifically, we design a single network with both multiple instance learning and bounding-box regression branches that share the same backbone. Meanwhile, a guided attention module using classification loss is added to the backbone for effectively extracting the implicit location information in the features. Experimental results on public datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."

However, delivering the three tasks simultaneously is extremely challenging due to the high variability of fundus structure and lack of datasets with complete annotations. In this paper, we propose an innovative Weakly-Supervised Multi-Task Learning method (WSMTL) for accurate evidence identification, optic disc segmentation and automated glaucoma diagnosis. The WSMTL method only uses weak-label data with binary diagnostic labels (normal/glaucoma) for training, while obtains pixel-level segmentation mask and diagnosis for testing. The WSMTL is constituted by a skip and densely connected CNN to capture multi-scale discriminative representation of fundus structure; a well-designed pyramid integration structure to generate high-resolution evidence map for evidence identification, in which the pixels with higher value represent higher confidence to highlight the abnormalities; a constrained clustering branch for optic disc segmentation; and a fully-connected discriminator for automated glaucoma diagnosis. Experimental results show that our proposed WSMTL effectively and simultaneously delivers evidence identification, optic disc segmentation (89.6% TP Dice), and accurate glaucoma diagnosis (92.4% AUC). This endows our WSMTL a great potential for the effective clinical assessment of glaucoma."

However, it is hard for one to keep a fixed activity when collecting desired activity data by wearable sensors, and the weakly labeled data inevitably occurs in the process of data collection. For now, human activity recognition methods have seldom been researched according to weakly labeled data, which deserves deep investigation. In this paper, we proposed a novel attention-based human activity recognition method to process the weakly labeled activity data. The traditional convolutional neural network (CNN)-based human activity recognition is modified by attention mechanism, which computes the compatibility between the global features extracted at the final fully connected layers and the local features extracted at a given convolutional layer. The attention-based CNN architecture can amplify the salient activity information and suppress the irrelevant and potentially confusing information by weighing up their compatibility. Our methods are compared with two state-of-the-art methods, CNN and DeepConvLSTM. The experimental results show that our model is comparably well on the traditional UCI HAR dataset and outperforms them on the weakly labeled dataset in accuracy.

The major difficulty lies in the uncertain figure-ground separation within each bounding box since there is no supervisory signal about it. We address the difficulty by formulating the problem as a multiple instance learning (MIL) task, and generate positive and negative bags based on the sweeping lines of each bounding box. The proposed deep model integrates MIL into a fully supervised instance segmentation network, and can be derived by the objective consisting of two terms, i.e., the unary term and the pairwise term. The former estimates the foreground and background areas of each bounding box while the latter maintains the unity of the estimated object masks.

Recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of deep neural networks (DNNs) for achieving remarkable performance in motion and music tasks with little effort for feature pre-processing. However, applying DNNs for generating dance to a piece of music is nevertheless challenging, because of 1) DNNs need to generate large sequences while mapping the music input, 2) the DNN needs to constraint the motion beat to the music, and 3) DNNs require a considerable amount of hand-crafted data. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep recurrent method for real-time basic dance generation with audio power spectrum as input. The proposed model employs convolutional layers and a multilayered Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) to process the audio input. Then, another deep LSTM layer decodes the target dance sequence. Notably, this end-to-end approach has 1) an auto-conditioned decode configuration that reduces accumulation of feedback error of large dance sequence, 2) uses a contrastive cost function to regulate the mapping between the music and motion beat, and 3) trains with weak labels generated from the motion beat, reducing the amount of hand-crafted data. We evaluate the proposed network based on i) the similarities between generated and the baseline dancer motion with a cross entropy measure for large dance sequences, and ii) accurate timing between the music and motion beat with an F-measure. Experimental results revealed that, after training using a small dataset, the model generates basic dance steps with low cross entropy and maintains an F-measure score similar to that of a baseline dancer."

Specifically, we first extract the subject, location and context features to represent the proposals and the query respectively. Then, we design the adaptive grounding module to compute the matching score between each proposal and query by a hierarchical attention model. Finally, based on attention score and proposal features, we reconstruct the input query with a collaborative loss of language reconstruction loss, adaptive reconstruction loss, and attribute classification loss. This adaptive mechanism helps our model to alleviate the variance of different referring expressions.

Qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed ARN can better handle the situation where multiple objects of a particular category situated together."

To mitigate this issue, we focus instead on improving the precision of the initial candidate object proposals. Since we cannot rely on localization annotations, we turn to video and leverage motion cues to automatically estimate the extent of objects to train a Weakly-supervised Region Proposal Network (W-RPN). We use the W-RPN to generate high precision object proposals, which are in turn used to re-rank high recall proposals like edge boxes or selective search according to their spatial overlap.

Our key contribution is a new constrained discriminative forward loss (CDFL) that we use for training the HMM and GRU under weak supervision. While prior work typically estimates the loss on a single, inferred video segmentation, our CDFL discriminates between the energy of all valid and invalid frame labelings of a training video. A valid frame labeling satisfies the ground-truth temporal ordering of actions, whereas an invalid one violates the ground truth.

Instead of simply labeling the top-scoring region and its highly overlapping regions as positive and others as negative, we propose more effective instance labeling methods as follows. First, to solve the problem that regions covering only some parts of the object tend to be labeled as positive, we find regions covering the whole object focusing on the context classification loss. Second, considering the situation where the other objects contained in the image can be labeled as negative, we impose a spatial restriction on regions labeled as negative. Using these instance labeling methods, we train the detector on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 and obtain significantly improved results compared with other state-of-the-art approaches."

We employ a self-attention saliency method to generate subtle saliency maps, and render the location cues grow as seeds by seeded region growing method to expand pixel-level labels extent. In the process of seeds growing, we use the saliency values to weight the similarity between pixels to control the growing. Therefore saliency information could help generate discriminative object regions, and the effects of wrong salient pixels can be suppressed efficiently.

In addition, we provide a study how different parameterizations of the normalized Lp layer affect the segmentation performance. This approach shows promising results for the given task. However, we think that the method has the potential to solve other weakly supervised segmentation problems as well."

To predict the existence of a particular attribute, it is demanded to localize the regions related to the attribute. However, in this task, the region annotations are not available. How to carve out these attribute-related regions remains challenging. Existing methods applied attribute-agnostic visual attention or heuristic body-part localization mechanisms to enhance the local feature representations, while neglecting to employ attributes to define local feature areas. We propose a flexible Attribute Localization Module (ALM) to adaptively discover the most discriminative regions and learns the regional features for each attribute at multiple levels. Moreover, a feature pyramid architecture is also introduced to enhance the attribute-specific localization at low-levels with high-level semantic guidance. The proposed framework does not require additional region annotations and can be trained end-to-end with multi-level deep supervision. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on three pedestrian attribute datasets, including PETA, RAP, and PA-100K."

Automatically detecting these aspects can be useful for both users and downstream opinion mining applications. Current supervised approaches for learning aspect classifiers require many fine-grained aspect labels, which are labor-intensive to obtain. And, unfortunately, unsupervised topic models often fail to capture the aspects of interest. In this work, we consider weakly supervised approaches for training aspect classifiers that only require the user to provide a small set of seed words (i.e., weakly positive indicators) for the aspects of interest. First, we show that current weakly supervised approaches fail to leverage the predictive power of seed words for aspect detection. Next, we propose a student-teacher approach that effectively leverages seed words in a bag-of-words classifier (teacher); in turn, we use the teacher to train a second model (student) that is potentially more powerful (e.g., a neural network that uses pre-trained word embeddings). Finally, we show that iterative co-training can be used to cope with noisy seed words, leading to both improved teacher and student models.

Unsupervised methods have been developed to overcome these limitations. However, they often rely on tedious parameter tuning and perform less well than supervised approaches, especially on data with high variability such as surgical trajectories. Hence, the potential of weak supervision could be to improve unsupervised learning while avoiding manual annotation of large datasets. In this paper, we used at a minimum one expert demonstration and its ground truth annotations to generate an appropriate initialization for a GMM-based algorithm for gesture recognition.

Weakly supervised learning with scribbles provides a good trade-off between model accuracy and the effort of manual labeling. However, for segmenting the hierarchical brain tumor structures, manually labeling scribbles for each substructure could still be demanding. In this paper, we use only two kinds of weak labels, i.e., scribbles on whole tumor and healthy brain tissue, and global labels for the presence of each substructure, to train a deep learning model to segment all the sub-regions. Specifically, we train two networks in two phases: first, we only use whole tumor scribbles to train a whole tumor (WT) segmentation network, which roughly recovers the WT mask of training data; then we cluster the WT region with the guide of global labels. The rough substructure segmentation from clustering is used as weak labels to train the second network. The dense CRF loss is used to refine the weakly supervised segmentation. We evaluate our approach on the BraTS2017 dataset and achieve competitive WT dice score as well as comparable scores on substructure segmentation compared to an upper bound when trained with fully annotated masks."

In this paper, we first observe that for many brain structures, a small number of training examples, (n=9), weakly labeled using Freesurfer 6.0, plus simple data augmentation, suffice as training data to achieve high performance, achieving an overall mean Dice coefficient of $0.84 \pm 0.12$ compared to Freesurfer over 28 brain structures in T1-weighted images of $\approx 4000$ 9-10 year-olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. We then examine two varieties of heteroscedastic network as a method for improving classification results. An existing proposal by Kendall and Gal, which uses Monte-Carlo inference to learn to predict the variance of each prediction, yields an overall mean Dice of $0.85 \pm 0.14$ and showed statistically significant improvements over 25 brain structures.

However, previous weakly supervised REG methods rarely pay attention to the relationship between the entities. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-guided pairwise reconstruction network (KPRN), which models the relationship between the target entity (subject) and contextual entity (object) as well as grounds these two entities. Specifically, we first design a knowledge extraction module to guide the proposal selection of subject and object. The prior knowledge is obtained in a specific form of semantic similarities between each proposal and the subject/object. Second, guided by such knowledge, we design the subject and object attention module to construct the subject-object proposal pairs. The subject attention excludes the unrelated proposals from the candidate proposals. The object attention selects the most suitable proposal as the contextual proposal. Third, we introduce a pairwise attention and an adaptive weighting scheme to learn the correspondence between these proposal pairs and the query. Finally, a pairwise reconstruction module is used to measure the grounding for weakly supervised learning.

While recent progress has been made for this problem, most of the existing methods ignore the compositionality in visual concept representation (e.g. objects are built from parts or composed of semantic attributes), which is key to the human ability to easily learn from a small number of examples. To enhance the few-shot learning models with compositionality, in this paper we present the simple yet powerful Compositional Feature Aggregation (CFA) module as a weakly-supervised regularization for deep networks. Given the deep feature maps extracted from the input, our CFA module first disentangles the feature space into disjoint semantic subspaces that model different attributes, and then bilinearly aggregates the local features within each of these subspaces. CFA explicitly regularizes the representation with both semantic and spatial compositionality to produce discriminative representations for few-shot recognition tasks. Moreover, our method does not need any supervision for attributes and object parts during training, thus can be conveniently plugged into existing models for end-to-end optimization while keeping the model size and computation cost nearly the same. Extensive experiments on few-shot image classification and action recognition tasks demonstrate that our method provides substantial improvements over recent state-of-the-art methods."

Most of the advanced algorithms follow the design principle that expands and constrains the seed regions from class activation maps (CAM).

Fortunately, we find that semantic segmentation has a characteristic of spatial transformation equivariance, which can form a few self-supervisions to help weakly supervised learning. This work mainly explores the advantages of scale equivariant constrains for CAM generation, formulated as a self-supervised scale equivariant network (SSENet). Specifically, a novel scale equivariant regularization is elaborately designed to ensure consistency of CAMs from the same input image with different resolutions. This novel scale equivariant regularization can guide the whole network to learn more accurate class activation.

While audio-based recognition of instruments has been widely studied, the visual aspect of music instrument playing remains largely unaddressed in the literature. One of the main obstacles is the difficulty in collecting annotated data of the action locations for training-based methods. To address this issue, we propose a weakly supervised framework to find when and where the instruments are played in the videos. We propose using two auxiliary models: 1) a sound model and 2) an object model to provide supervision for training the instrument-playing action model.

The resulting model only needs to analyze the visual part of a music video to deduce which, when, and where instruments are played.

As weakly supervised detection only uses image level labels and does not require the ground truth of bounding box location and label of each object in an image, it is generally very difficult to distill knowledge of the actual appearances of objects. Inspired by curriculum learning, this paper proposes an easy-to-hard knowledge transfer scheme that incorporates easy web images to provide prior knowledge of object appearance as a good starting point. While exploiting large-scale free web imagery, we introduce a sophisticated labor-free method to construct a web dataset with good diversity in object appearance.

Since the frame-level or segment-level annotations of untrimmed videos require amounts of labor expenditure, studies on the weakly-supervised action detection have been springing up. However, most of existing frameworks rely on Class Activation Sequence (CAS) to localize actions by minimizing the video-level classification loss, which exploits the most discriminative parts of actions but ignores the minor regions. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised framework by adversarial learning of two modules for eliminating such demerits. Specifically, the first module is designed as a well-designed Seeded Sequence Growing (SSG) Network for progressively extending seed regions (namely the highly reliable regions initialized by a CAS-based framework) to their expected boundaries. The second module is a specific classifier for mining trivial or incomplete action regions, which is trained on the shared features after erasing the seeded regions activated by SSG. In this way, a whole network composed of these two modules can be trained in an adversarial manner. The goal of the adversary is to mine features that are difficult for the action classifier. That is, erasion from SSG will force the classifier to discover minor or even new action regions on the input feature sequence, and the classifier will drive the seeds to grow, alternately. At last, we could obtain the action locations and categories from the well-trained SSG and the classifier.

To remedy this situation, weakly supervised methods leverage other forms of supervision that require substantially less annotation effort, but they typically present an inability to predict precise object boundaries due to approximate nature of the supervisory signals in those regions. While great progress has been made in improving the performance, many of these weakly supervised methods are highly tailored to their own specific settings. This raises challenges in reusing algorithms and making steady progress. In this paper, we intentionally avoid such practices when tackling weakly supervised semantic segmentation. In particular, we train standard neural networks with partial cross-entropy loss function for the labeled pixels and our proposed Gated CRF loss for the unlabeled pixels. The Gated CRF loss is designed to deliver several important assets: 1) it enables flexibility in the kernel construction to mask out influence from undesired pixel positions; 2) it offloads learning contextual relations to CNN and concentrates on semantic boundaries; 3) it does not rely on high-dimensional filtering and thus has a simple implementation. Throughout the paper we present the advantages of the loss function, analyze several aspects of weakly supervised training, and show that our `purist' approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for both click-based and scribble-based annotations."

We use extreme points in each dimension of a 3D medical image to constrain an initial segmentation based on the random walker algorithm. This segmentation is then used as a weak supervisory signal to train a fully convolutional network that can segment the organ of interest based on the provided user clicks. We show that the network's predictions can be refined through several iterations of training and prediction using the same weakly annotated data. Ultimately, our method has the potential to speed up the generation process of new training datasets for the development of new machine learning and deep learning-based models for, but not exclusively, medical image analysis."

For fully supervised semantic segmentation, the task is achieved by a segmentation model trained using pixel-level annotations. However, the pixel-level annotation process is very expensive and time-consuming. To reduce the cost, the paper proposes a semantic candidate regions trained extreme learning machine (ELM) method with image-level labels to achieve pixel-level labels mapping. In this work, the paper casts the pixel mapping problem into a candidate region semantic inference problem. Specifically, after segmenting each image into a set of superpixels, superpixels are automatically combined to achieve segmentation of candidate region according to the number of image-level labels. Semantic inference of candidate regions is realized based on the relationship and neighborhood rough set associated with semantic labels. Finally, the paper trains the ELM using the candidate regions of the inferred labels to classify the test candidate regions. The experiment is verified on the MSRC dataset and PASCAL VOC 2012, which are popularly used in semantic segmentation.

A light model is first obtained by training with the pixel-level annotated data and then used to annotate unlabeled or weakly labeled data. A novel strategy which utilizes ground-truth bounding boxes to generate pseudo mask annotations is proposed in weakly-supervised learning.

In SSOD, instead of annotating all the instances in the whole training set, people only need to annotate the part of the training instances using bounding boxes. In WSOD, people need to annotate the image-level tags on all training images to indicate the object categories contained by the corresponding images since more detailed bounding box annotations are no longer needed. Along this line of research, this paper makes a further step to alleviate the human labor in annotating training data, leading to the problem of object detection with semi-annotated weak labels (ODSAWLs). Instead of labeling image-level tags on all training images, ODSAWL only needs the image-level tags for a small portion of the training images, and then, the object detectors can be learned from a small portion of the weakly-labeled training images and from the remaining unlabeled training images. To address such a challenging problem, this paper proposes a cross model co-training framework that collaborates an object localizer and a tag generator in an alternative optimization procedure. Specifically, during the learning procedure, these two (deep) models can transfer the needed knowledge (including labels and visual patterns) between each other. The whole learning procedure is accomplished in a few stages under the guidance of a progressive learning curriculum. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we implement the comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, where the obtained experimental results are quite encouraging. Notably, by using only about 15% weakly labeled training images, the proposed approach can effectively approach, or even outperform, the state-of-the-art WSOD methods."

One major reason for this huge gap is the incomplete box detection problem which arises because most previous WSOD models are structured on classification networks and therefore tend to recognize the most discriminative parts instead of complete bounding boxes. To solve this problem, we define a low-shot weakly supervised object detection task and propose a novel low-shot box correction network to address it. The proposed task enables to train object detectors on a large data set all of which have image-level annotations, but only a small portion or few shots have box annotations. Given the low-shot box annotations, we use a novel box correction network to transfer the incomplete boxes into complete ones. Extensive empirical evidence shows that our proposed method yields stateof-art detection accuracy under various settings on the PASCAL VOC benchmark."

In this study we propose to combine both approaches in a model that is principally apt for WSOD, but receives full position ground truth for a small number of images. Experiments show that with just 1% of densely annotated images, but simple image-level counts as remaining ground truth, we effectively match the performance of fully-supervised models on a challenging dataset with scarcely occurring wildlife on UAV images from the African savanna. As a result, with a very limited amount of precise annotations our model can be trained with ground truth that is orders of magnitude cheaper and faster to obtain while still providing the same detection performance."

On the other hand, some information is often known about the contents of images. We leverage information on whether an image presents the segmentation target or whether it is absent from the image to improve segmentation performance by augmenting the amount of data usable for model training. Specifically, we propose a semi-supervised framework that employs image-to-image translation between weak labels (e.g., presence vs. absence of cancer), in addition to fully supervised segmentation on some examples. We conjecture that this translation objective is well aligned with the segmentation objective as both require the same disentangling of image variations. Building on prior image-to-image translation work, we re-use the encoder and decoders for translating in either direction between two domains, employing a strategy of selectively decoding domain-specific variations. For presence vs. absence domains, the encoder produces variations that are common to both and those unique to the presence domain. Furthermore, we successfully re-use one of the decoders used in translation for segmentation. We validate the proposed method on synthetic tasks of varying difficulty as well as on the real task of brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance images, where we show significant improvements over standard semi-supervised training with autoencoding."

However, correct classification results would not guarantee sufficient localization performance since the model may only focus on the most discriminative parts rather than the entire object. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel and end-to-end trainable network for weakly-supervised object localization. The key insights to our algorithm are two-fold. First, to encourage our model to focus on detecting foreground objects, we develop a salient object detection module. Second, we propose a perceptual triplet loss that further enhances the foreground object detection capability. As such, our model learns to predict objectness, resulting in more accurate localization results. We conduct experiments on the challenging ILSVRC dataset.

However, obtaining precise 6 degrees of freedom for ground-truth can be prohibitively expensive. This work therefore proposes an architecture and a training process to solve this issue. More precisely, we present a weak object detector that enables localizing objects and estimating their 6D poses in cluttered and occluded scenes. To minimize the human labor required for annotations, the proposed detector is trained with a combination of synthetic and a few weakly annotated real images (as little as 10 images per object), for which a human provides only a list of objects present in each image (no time-consuming annotations, such as bounding boxes, segmentation masks and object poses). To close the gap between real and synthetic images, we use multiple domain classifiers trained adversarially. During the inference phase, the resulting class-specific heatmaps of the weak detector are used to guide the search of 6D poses of objects. Our proposed approach is evaluated on several publicly available datasets for pose estimation. We also evaluated our model on classification and localization in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

The high demand for localization accuracy has been essential for safe robot planing and navigation while it makes the current geometric solutions less robust to environmental changes. Recent research on end-to-end methods handle raw sensory data with forms of navigation instructions and directly output the command for robot control. However, the lack of intermediate semantics makes the system more rigid and unstable for practical use. To explore these issues, this paper proposes an innovate navigation framework based on the GPS-level localization, which takes the raw perception data with publicly accessible navigation maps to produce an intermediate navigation cost map that allows subsequent flexible motion planning. A deterministic conditional adversarial network is adopted in our method to generate visual goal-directed paths under diverse navigation conditions. The adversarial loss avoids the pixel-level annotation and enables a weakly supervised training strategy to implicitly learn both of the traffic semantics in image perceptions and the planning intentions in navigation instructions. The navigation cost map is then rendered from the goal-directed path and the concurrently collected laser data, indicating the way towards the destination. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted with a real vehicle running in our campus and the results have verified the robustness to localization error of the proposed navigation system."

This powerful weakly-supervised framework alleviates the burden of the imprecise and time consuming process of annotating event locations in temporal data.

This unique feature is a direct consequence of the model’s theoretical properties. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in a number of experiments (drum hit and piano onset detection in audio, digit detection in images) and demonstrate performance comparable to that of fully-supervised state-of-the-art methods, despite much weaker training requirements."

Specifically, we present Action Coherence Network (ACN) for W-TAL, which features a new coherence loss that better supervises action boundary learning and facilitate proposal regression. In addition, a purpose-built fusion module is proposed for localization inference based on features extracted by two streams of convolutional neural network. Overall, the proposed ACN achieves state-of-the-art W-TAL performance on two challenging datasets (THU-MOS14 and ActivityNet1.2, particularly ACN attains mAP of 24.2% on THUMOS14 under IoU threshold 0.5), which is approaching some recent fully-supervised TAL methods."

Previous effort required human annotations of the completion moment for training (i.e. full supervision). In this work, we present an approach for moment detection from weak video-level labels. Given both complete and incomplete sequences, of the same action, we learn temporal attention, along with accumulated completion prediction from all frames in the sequence. We also demonstrate how the approach can be used when completion moment supervision is available. We evaluate and compare our approach on actions from three datasets, namely HMDB, UCF101 and RGBD-AC, and show that temporal attention improves detection in both weakly-supervised and fully-supervised settings."

Hence, modern object detection algorithms are difficult to be deployed in robotic applications that require on-line learning. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised strategy for training an object detector in this scenario. The main idea is to let the robot iteratively grow a training set by combining autonomously annotated examples, with others that are requested for human supervision.

Frame-level supervised learning is challenging because we cannot use location information for training the networks. Therefore, some constraints are introduced for guiding foreground locations. Previous works exploit prior information on foreground sizes and shapes. In this work, we propose two constraints for weakly supervised background subtraction networks. Our constraints use binary mask images generated by simple background subtraction. Unlike previous works, our approach does not require prior information on foreground sizes and shapes. Moreover, our constraints are more suitable for change detection tasks.

Increasingly, machine learning methods are applied due to their superior performance. However, typical images obtained by scanning histological sections often have a resolution that is prohibitive for processing with current state-of-the-art neural networks. Furthermore, the data pose a problem of weak labels, since only a tiny fraction of the image is indicative of the disease class, whereas a large fraction of the image is highly similar to the non-disease class. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether it is possible to detect basal cell carcinomas in histological sections using attention-based deep learning models and to overcome the ultra-high resolution and the weak labels of whole slide images.

Many existing Weakly-Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) approaches tackle this problem by estimating the most discriminative regions with feature maps (activation maps) obtained by Deep Convolutional Neural Network, that is, only the objects or parts of them with the most discriminative response will be located. However, the activation maps often display different local maximum responses or relatively weak response when one image contains multiple objects with the same type or small objects. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective multi-scale discriminative region discovery method to localize not only more integral objects but also as many as possible with only image-level class labels. The gradient weights flowing into different convolutional layers of CNN are taken as the input of our method, which is different from previous methods only considering that of the final convolutional layer. To mine more discriminative regions for the task of object localization, the multiple local maximum from the gradient weight maps are leveraged to generate the localization map with a parallel sliding window. Furthermore, multi-scale localization maps from different convolutional layers are fused to produce the final result. We evaluate the proposed method with the foundation of VGGnet on the ILSVRC 2016, CUB-200-2011 and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets. On ILSVRC 2016, the proposed method yields the Top-1 localization error of 48.65\%, which outperforms previous results by 2.75\%.

Specifically, we present a dual attention module for information fusion, consisting of a position branch and a channel one. In each branch, the input feature map is deduced into an enhancement map and a mask map, thereby highlighting the most discriminative parts or hiding them. For the position mask map, we introduce a focused matrix to enhance it, which utilizes the principle that the pixels of an object are continuous. Between these two branches, the enhancement map is integrated with the mask map, aiming at partially compensating the lost information and diversifies the features. With the dual-attention module and focused matrix, the entire object region could be precisely recognized with implicit information. We demonstrate outperforming results of DFM in experiments. In particular, DFM achieves state-of-the-art performance in localization accuracy in ILSVRC 2016 and CUB-200-2011."

Deep learning models for WSOL rely typically on convolutional attention maps with no constraints on the regions of interest which allows these models to select any region, making them vulnerable to false positive regions and inconsistent predictions. This issue occurs in many application domains, e.g., medical image analysis, where interpretability is central to the prediction process. In order to improve the localization reliability, we propose a deep learning framework for WSOL with pixel level localization. Our framework is composed of two sequential sub-networks: a localizer that localizes regions of interest; followed by a classifier that classifies these regions. Within its end-to-end training, we incorporate the prior knowledge stating that, in an agnostic-class setup, an image is more likely to contain relevant –i.e., object of interest– and irrelevant regions –i.e., noise, background–. Based on the conditional entropy measured at the classifier level, the localizer is driven to spot relevant regions identified with low conditional entropy, and irrelevant regions identified with high conditional entropy. Our framework is able to recover large and even complete discriminative regions in an image using our recursive erasing algorithm that we incorporate within the backpropagation during training. Moreover, the framework handles intrinsically multi-instances. Experimental results on public datasets with medical images (GlaS colon cancer) and natural images (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011) show that, compared to state of the art WSOL methods, the proposed approach can provide significant improvements in terms of image-level classification and pixellevel localization. Our framework showed robustness to overfitting when dealing with few training samples.

However, training these networks requires access to densely labeled images, which are known to be very expensive to obtain. On the other hand, the web provides an almost unlimited source of images annotated at the image level. How can one utilize this much larger weakly annotated set for tasks that require dense labeling? Prior work often relied on localization cues, such as saliency maps, objectness priors, bounding boxes etc., to address this challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a model that generates auxiliary labels for each image, while simultaneously forcing the output of the CNN to satisfy the mean-field constraints imposed by a conditional random field. We show that one can enforce the CRF constraints by forcing the distribution at each pixel to be close to the distribution of its neighbors. This is in stark contrast with methods that compute a recursive expansion of the mean-field distribution using a recurrent architecture and train the resultant distribution. Instead, the proposed model adds an extra loss term to the output of the CNN, and hence, is faster than recursive implementations.

In particular, we propose spatial context networks that learn to predict a representation of one image patch from another image patch, within the same image, conditioned on their real-valued relative spatial offset. Unlike auto-encoders, that aim to encode and reconstruct original image patches, our network aims to encode and reconstruct intermediate representations of the spatially offset patches. As such, the network learns a spatially conditioned contextual representation. By testing performance with various patch selection mechanisms we show that focusing on object-centric patches is important, and that using object proposal as a patch selection mechanism leads to the highest improvement in performance. Further, unlike auto-encoders, context encoders [21], or other forms of unsupervised feature learning, we illustrate that contextual supervision (with pre-trained model initialization) can improve on existing pre-trained model performance. We build our spatial context networks on top of standard VGG_19 and CNN_M architectures and, among other things, show that we can achieve improvements (with no additional explicit supervision) over the original ImageNet pre-trained VGG_19 and CNN_M models in object categorization and detection on VOC2007."

Today, manual human visual inspection is still the norm because it is difficult to automate anomaly detection. Neural networks are a useful tool that can teach a machine to find defects. However, they require a lot of training examples to learn what a defect is and it is tedious and expensive to get these samples. We tackle the problem of teaching a network with a low number of training samples with a system we call AnoNet. AnoNet's architecture is similar to CompactCNN with the exceptions that (1) it is a fully convolutional network and does not use strided convolution; (2) it is shallow and compact which minimizes over-fitting by design; (3) the compact design constrains the size of intermediate features which allows training to be done without image downsizing; (4) the model footprint is low making it suitable for edge computation; and (5) the anomaly can be detected and localized despite the weak labelling. AnoNet learns to detect the underlying shape of the anomalies despite the weak annotation as well as preserves the spatial localization of the anomaly. Pre-seeding AnoNet with an engineered filter bank initialization technique reduces the total samples required for training and also achieves state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the CompactCNN, AnoNet achieved a massive 94% reduction of network parameters from 1.13 million to 64 thousand parameters. Experiments were conducted on four data-sets and results were compared against CompactCNN and DeepLabv3. AnoNet improved the performance on an average across all data-sets by 106% to an F1 score of 0.98 and by 13% to an AUROC value of 0.942. AnoNet can learn from a limited number of images. For one of the data-sets, AnoNet learnt to detect anomalies after a single pass through just 53 training images."

Drift adaptation has not yet been addressed in high dimensional, noisy, low-context data such as streaming text, video, or images due to the unique challenges these domains present. We present a two-fold approach to deal with concept drift in these domains: a density-based clustering approach to deal with virtual concept drift (change in statistical properties of features) and a weak-supervision step to deal with real concept drift (change in statistical properties of target). Our density-based clustering avoids problems posed by the curse of dimensionality to create an evolving 'map' of the live data space, thereby addressing virtual drift in features. Our weak-supervision step leverages high-confidence labels (oracle or heuristic labels) to generate weighted training sets to generalize and update existing deep learners to adapt to changing decision boundaries (real drift) and create new deep learners for unseen regions of the data space. Our results show that our two-fold approach performs well with >90% precision in 2018, four years after initial deployment in 2014, without any human intervention."

They do not require additional curation as it is the case for the clean class tags used by current weakly supervised approaches and they provide textual context for the classes present in an image. To leverage such textual context, we deploy a multi-modal network that learns a joint embedding of the visual representation of the image and the textual representation of the caption. The network estimates text activation maps (TAMs) for class names as well as compound concepts, i.e. combinations of nouns and their attributes. The TAMs of compound concepts describing classes of interest substantially improve the quality of the estimated class activation maps which are then used to train a network for semantic segmentation. We evaluate our method on the COCO dataset where it achieves state of the art results for weakly supervised image segmentation."

Often, intravascular optical coherence tomography is used to assess potential malapposition after implantation and for follow-up examinations later on. Typically, the scaffold is manually reviewed by an expert, analyzing each of the hundreds of image slices. As this is time consuming, automatic stent detection and visualization approaches have been proposed, mostly for metal stent detection based on classic image processing. As bioresorbable scaffolds are harder to detect, recent approaches have used feature extraction and machine learning methods for automatic detection. However, these methods require detailed, pixel-level labels in each image slice and extensive feature engineering for the particular stent type which might limit the approaches' generalization capabilities. Therefore, we propose a deep learning-based method for bioresorbable scaffold visualization using only image-level labels. A convolutional neural network is trained to predict whether an image slice contains a metal stent, a bioresorbable scaffold, or no device. Then, we derive local stent strut information by employing weakly supervised localization using saliency maps with guided backpropagation. As saliency maps are generally diffuse and noisy, we propose a novel patch-based method with image shifting which allows for high resolution stent visualization. Our convolutional neural network model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.0 % for image-level stent classification which can be used for both high quality in-slice stent visualization and 3D rendering of the stent structure."

In the context of brain tumor segmentation, both pixel-level and image-level annotations are commonly available; thus, a natural question arises whether a segmentation procedure could take advantage of both. In the present work we: 1) propose a learning-based framework that allows simultaneous usage of both pixel-and image-level annotations in MRI images to learn a segmentation model for brain tumor; 2) study the influence of comparative amounts of pixel-and image-level annotations on the quality of brain tumor segmentation; 3) compare our approach to the traditional fully-supervised approach and show that the performance of our method in terms of segmentation quality may be competitive."

Deep learning models for WSOL rely typically on convolutional attention maps with no constraints on the regions of interest which allows these models to select any region, making them vulnerable to false positive regions and inconsistent predictions. This issue occurs in many application domains, e.g., medical image analysis, where interpretability is central to the prediction process. In order to improve the localization reliability, we propose a deep learning framework for WSOL with pixel level localization. Our framework is composed of two sequential sub-networks: a localizer that localizes regions of interest; followed by a classifier that classifies these regions. Within its end-to-end training, we incorporate the prior knowledge stating that, in an agnostic-class setup, an image is more likely to contain relevant –i.e., object of interest– and irrelevant regions –i.e., noise, background–. Based on the conditional entropy measured at the classifier level, the localizer is driven to spot relevant regions identified with low conditional entropy, and irrelevant regions identified with high conditional entropy. Our framework is able to recover large and even complete discriminative regions in an image using our recursive erasing algorithm that we incorporate within the backpropagation during training. Moreover, the framework handles intrinsically multi-instances. Experimental results on public datasets with medical images (GlaS colon cancer) and natural images (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011, Oxford flower 102) show that, compared to state of the art WSOL methods, the proposed approach can provide significant improvements in terms of image-level classification and pixel-level localization. Our framework showed robustness to overfitting when dealing with few training samples. Performance improvements are due in large part to our framework effectiveness at disregarding irrelevant regions.

Traditionally, such a problem is approached in a fully-supervised setting where video-clips with complete frame-by-frame annotations around the actions of interest are provided for training.

In this work, we circumvent this issue by casting the problem in a weakly supervised setting, i.e., by considering videos as labelled `sets' of unlabelled video segments. Firstly, we apply unsupervised segmentation to take advantage of the elementary structure of each video. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network is used to extract RGB features from the resulting video segments. Finally, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is employed to predict labels at the video segment level, thus inherently performing spatio-temporal action detection. In contrast to previous work, we make use of a different MIL formulation in which the label of each video segment is continuous rather then discrete, making the resulting optimization function tractable. Additionally, we utilize a set splitting technique for regularization. Experimental results considering multiple performance indicators on the UCF-Sports data-set support the effectiveness of our approach."

In MRFSWSnet, multiple receptive fields block (MRF) is used to pay attention to the object and its adjacent background's different spatial location with different weights to enhance the feature's discriminability. In addition, in order to improve the accuracy of small object detection, a small-object-focusing weakly-supervised segmentation module which only focuses on small object instead of all objects is integrated into the detection network for auxiliary training to improve the precision of small object detection. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO detection datasets.

However, these methods (i) ignore the information contained in positive bags; (ii) only rank the likelihood but cannot generate an explicit decision function. In this study, the authors propose a voting scheme involving not only the definite negative instances but also the ambiguous positive instances to make use of the extra useful information in the weakly labelled positive bags. In the scheme, each instance votes for its label with a magnitude arising from the similarity, and the ambiguous positive instances are assigned soft labels that are iteratively updated during the voting. It overcomes the limitations of voting using only the negative bags. They also propose an expectation kernel density estimation algorithm to gain further insight into the voting mechanism.

This results in the fact that a deep learning model trained on data from one vendor cannot readily be applied to data from another vendor. This paper investigates the use of tailored transfer learning methods based on adversarial learning to tackle this problem. We consider a database of DM exams (mostly bilateral and two views) generated by Hologic and Siemens vendors.

We then present a simple network architecture including two parallel-classifiers for object localization. Specifically, we leverage one classification branch to dynamically localize some discriminative object regions during the forward pass. Although it is usually responsive to sparse parts of the target objects, this classifier can drive the counterpart classifier to discover new and complementary object regions by erasing its discovered regions from the feature maps. With such an adversarial learning, the two parallel-classifiers are forced to leverage complementary object regions for classification and can finally generate integral object localization together. The merits of ACoL are mainly two-fold: 1) it can be trained in an end-to-end manner; 2) dynamically erasing enables the counterpart classifier to discover complementary object regions more effectively. We demonstrate the superiority of our ACoL approach in a variety of experiments. In particular, the Top-1 localization error rate on the ILSVRC dataset is 45.14%, which is the new state-of-the-art."

To alleviate this issue, we present a novel framework that generates segmentation labels of images given their image-level class labels. In this weakly supervised setting, trained models have been known to segment local discriminative parts rather than the entire object area. Our solution is to propagate such local responses to nearby areas which belong to the same semantic entity. To this end, we propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) called AffinityNet that predicts semantic affinity between a pair of adjacent image coordinates. The semantic propagation is then realized by random walk with the affinities predicted by AffinityNet. More importantly, the supervision employed to train AffinityNet is given by the initial discriminative part segmentation, which is incomplete as a segmentation annotation but sufficient for learning semantic affinities within small image areas. Thus the entire framework relies only on image-level class labels and does not require any extra data or annotations. On the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, a DNN learned with segmentation labels generated by our method outperforms previous models trained with the same level of supervision, and is even as competitive as those relying on stronger supervision."

To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose an iterative bottom-up and top-down framework which alternatively expands object regions and optimizes segmentation network. We start from initial localization produced by classification networks. While classification networks are only responsive to small and coarse discriminative object regions, we argue that, these regions contain significant common features about objects. So in the bottom-up step, we mine common object features from the initial localization and expand object regions with the mined features. To supplement non-discriminative regions, saliency maps are then considered under Bayesian framework to refine the object regions. Then in the top-down step, the refined object regions are used as supervision to train the segmentation network and to predict object masks. These object masks provide more accurate localization and contain more regions of object. Further, we take these object masks as initial localization and mine common object features from them. These processes are conducted iteratively to progressively produce fine object masks and optimize segmentation networks. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin."

In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem by exploiting class peak responses to enable a classification network for instance mask extraction. With image labels supervision only, CNN classifiers in a fully convolutional manner can produce class response maps, which specify classification confidence at each image location. We observed that local maximums, i.e., peaks, in a class response map typically correspond to strong visual cues residing inside each instance. Motivated by this, we first design a process to stimulate peaks to emerge from a class response map. The emerged peaks are then back-propagated and effectively mapped to highly informative regions of each object instance, such as instance boundaries. We refer to the above maps generated from class peak responses as Peak Response Maps (PRMs). PRMs provide a fine-detailed instance-level representation, which allows instance masks to be extracted even with some off-the-shelf methods. To the best of our knowledge, we for the first time report results for the challenging image-level supervised instance segmentation task.

ABSTRACT One of the fundamental challenges in supervised learning for multimodal image registration is the lack of ground‐truth for voxel‐level spatial correspondence. This work describes a method to infer voxel‐level transformation from higher‐level correspondence information contained in anatomical labels. We argue that such labels are more reliable and practical to obtain for reference sets of image pairs than voxel‐level correspondence. Typical anatomical labels of interest may include solid organs, vessels, ducts, structure boundaries and other subject‐specific ad hoc landmarks. The proposed end‐to‐end convolutional neural network approach aims to predict displacement fields to align multiple labelled corresponding structures for individual image pairs during the training, while only unlabelled image pairs are used as the network input for inference. We highlight the versatility of the proposed strategy, for training, utilising diverse types of anatomical labels, which need not to be identifiable over all training image pairs. At inference, the resulting 3D deformable image registration algorithm runs in real‐time and is fully‐automated without requiring any anatomical labels or initialisation. Several network architecture variants are compared for registering T2‐weighted magnetic resonance images and 3D transrectal ultrasound images from prostate cancer patients. A median target registration error of 3.6 mm on landmark centroids and a median Dice of 0.87 on prostate glands are achieved from cross‐validation experiments, in which 108 pairs of multimodal images from 76 patients were tested with high‐quality anatomical labels.

In this pipeline, we first obtain intermediate object localization and pixel labeling results for the training images, and then use such results to train task-specific deep networks in a fully supervised manner. The entire process consists of four stages, including object localization in the training images, filtering and fusing object instances, pixel labeling for the training images, and task-specific network training. To obtain clean object instances in the training images, we propose a novel algorithm for filtering, fusing and classifying object instances collected from multiple solution mechanisms. In this algorithm, we incorporate both metric learning and density-based clustering to filter detected object instances.

Common weakly-supervised approaches generate full masks from partial input (e.g. scribbles or seeds) using standard interactive segmentation methods as preprocessing. But, errors in such masks result in poorer training since standard loss functions (e.g. cross-entropy) do not distinguish seeds from potentially mislabeled other pixels. Inspired by the general ideas in semi-supervised learning, we address these problems via a new principled loss function evaluating network output with criteria standard in ""shallow"" segmentation, e.g. normalized cut. Unlike prior work, the cross entropy part of our loss evaluates only seeds where labels are known while normalized cut softly evaluates consistency of all pixels. We focus on normalized cut loss where dense Gaussian kernel is efficiently implemented in linear time by fast Bilateral filtering. Our normalized cut loss approach to segmentation brings the quality of weakly-supervised training significantly closer to fully supervised methods."

In contrast, we integrate such standard regularizers directly into the loss functions over partial input. This approach simplifies weakly-supervised training by avoiding extra MRF/CRF inference steps or layers explicitly generating full masks, while improving both the quality and efficiency of training. This paper proposes and experimentally compares different losses integrating MRF/CRF regularization terms. We juxtapose our regularized losses with earlier proposal-generation methods using explicit regularization steps or layers.

Naive classification approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) show excellent performance in detecting image manipulations when they are trained on a specific forgery method. However, on examples from unseen manipulation approaches, their performance drops significantly. To address this limitation in transferability, we introduce Forensic-Transfer (FT). We devise a learning-based forensic detector which adapts well to new domains, i.e., novel manipulation methods and can handle scenarios where only a handful of fake examples are available during training. To this end, we learn a forensic embedding based on a novel autoencoder-based architecture that can be used to distinguish between real and fake imagery. The learned embedding acts as a form of anomaly detector; namely, an image manipulated from an unseen method will be detected as fake provided it maps sufficiently far away from the cluster of real images. Comparing to prior works, FT shows significant improvements in transferability, which we demonstrate in a series of experiments on cutting-edge benchmarks. For instance, on unseen examples, we achieve up to 85% in terms of accuracy, and with only a handful of seen examples, our performance already reaches around 95%."

Specifically, TS2C is developed based on two key properties of desirable bounding boxes: (1) high purity, meaning most pixels in the box are with high object response, and (2) high completeness, meaning the box covers high object response pixels comprehensively.

SED is typically posed as a supervised machine learning problem, requiring strong annotations for the presence or absence of each sound source at every time instant within the recording. However, strong annotations of this type are both labor- and cost-intensive for human annotators to produce, which limits the practical scalability of SED methods. In this paper, we treat SED as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, where training labels are static over a short excerpt, indicating the presence or absence of sound sources but not their temporal locality. The models, however, must still produce temporally dynamic predictions, which must be aggregated (pooled) when comparing against static labels during training. To facilitate this aggregation, we develop a family of adaptive pooling operators—referred to as autopool—which smoothly interpolate between common pooling operators, such as min-, max-, or average-pooling, and automatically adapt to the characteristics of the sound sources in question. We evaluate the proposed pooling operators on three datasets, and demonstrate that in each case, the proposed methods outperform nonadaptive pooling operators for static prediction, and nearly match the performance of models trained with strong, dynamic annotations. The proposed method is evaluated in conjunction with convolutional neural networks, but can be readily applied to any differentiable model for time-series label prediction.

Towards this goal, we first develop a criterion named mean Energy Accumulation Scores (mEAS) to automatically measure and rank localization difficulty of an image containing the target object, and accordingly learn the detector progressively by feeding examples with increasing difficulty. In this way, the model can be well prepared by training on easy examples for learning from more difficult ones and thus gain a stronger detection ability more efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce a novel masking regularization strategy over the high level convolutional feature maps to avoid overfitting initial samples. These two modules formulate a zigzag learning process, where progressive learning endeavors to discover reliable object instances, and masking regularization increases the difficulty of finding object instances properly.

Without the need of annotating bounding boxes, the existing methods usually follow a two/multi-stage pipeline with an online compulsive stage to extract object proposals, which is an order of magnitude slower than fast fully supervised object detectors such as SSD [31] and YOLO [34]. In this paper, we speedup online weakly supervised object detectors by orders of magnitude by proposing a novel generative adversarial learning paradigm. In the proposed paradigm, the generator is a one-stage object detector to generate bounding boxes from images. To guide the learning of object-level generator, a surrogator is introduced to mine high-quality bounding boxes for training. We further adapt a structural similarity loss in combination with an adversarial loss into the training objective, which solves the challenge that the bounding boxes produced by the surrogator may not well capture their ground truth. Our one-stage detector outperforms all existing schemes in terms of detection accuracy, running at 118 frames per second, which is up to 438Ã— faster than the state-of-the-art weakly supervised detectors [8, 30, 15, 27, 45].

Based Syst.,2018.0,45,"In order to maximize the applicability of sentiment analysis results, it is necessary to not only classify the overall sentiment (positive/negative) of a given document but also to identify the main words that contribute to the classification. However, most datasets for sentiment analysis only have the sentiment label for each document or sentence. In other words, there is no information about which words play an important role in sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying key words discriminating positive and negative sentences by using a weakly supervised learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In our model, each word is represented as a continuous-valued vector and each sentence is represented as a matrix whose rows correspond to the word vector used in the sentence. Then, the CNN model is trained using these sentence matrices as inputs and the sentiment labels as the output. Once the CNN model is trained, we implement the word attention mechanism that identifies high-contributing words to classification results with a class activation map, using the weights from the fully connected layer at the end of the learned CNN model. In order to verify the proposed methodology, we evaluated the classification accuracy and inclusion rate of polarity words using two movie review datasets. Experimental result show that the proposed model can not only correctly classify the sentence polarity but also successfully identify the corresponding words with high polarity scores."

Despite their coarseness, RECIST markers are commonly found in current hospital picture and archiving systems (PACS), meaning they can provide a potentially powerful, yet extraordinarily challenging, source of weak supervision for full 3D segmentation. Toward this end, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) based weakly supervised slice-propagated segmentation (WSSS) method to (1) generate the initial lesion segmentation on the axial RECIST-slice; (2) learn the data distribution on RECIST-slices; (3) extrapolate to segment the whole lesion slice by slice to finally obtain a volumetric segmentation.

Our graph-partitioning-based clustering algorithm allows us to consider the relationships between all salient instances in the training set as well as the information within them. We further show that with the help of attention information, our clustering algorithm is able to correct certain wrong assignments, leading to more accurate results.

While most works in this area assume an ordered sequence of occurring actions to be given, our approach only uses a set of actions. Such action sets provide much less supervision since neither action ordering nor the number of action occurrences are known. In exchange, they can be easily obtained, for instance, from meta-tags, while ordered sequences still require human annotation. We introduce a system that automatically learns to temporally segment and label actions in a video, where the only supervision that is used are action sets.

Existing methods found the region-level cues (e.g., features from RoIs) can facilitate multi-label classification. Nevertheless, such methods usually require laborious object-level annotations (i.e., object labels and bounding boxes) for effective learning of the object-level visual features. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient deep framework to boost multi-label classification by distilling knowledge from weakly-supervised detection task without bounding box annotations. Specifically, given the image-level annotations, (1) we first develop a weakly-supervised detection (WSD) model, and then (2) construct an end-to-end multi-label image classification framework augmented by a knowledge distillation module that guides the classification model by the WSD model according to the class-level predictions for the whole image and the object-level visual features for object RoIs. The WSD model is the teacher model and the classification model is the student model. After this cross-task knowledge distillation, the performance of the classification model is significantly improved and the efficiency is maintained since the WSD model can be safely discarded in the test phase. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets (MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE) show that our framework achieves superior performances over the state-of-the-art methods on both performance and efficiency."

We propose to use the combination of a coarse salient object activation map from the classification network and saliency maps generated from unsupervised methods as pixel-level annotation, and develop a simple yet very effective algorithm to train fully convolutional networks for salient object detection supervised by these noisy annotations. Our algorithm is based on alternately exploiting a graphical model and training a fully convolutional network for model updating. The graphical model corrects the internal labeling ambiguity through spatial consistency and structure preserving while the fully convolutional network helps to correct the cross-image semantic ambiguity and simultaneously update the coarse activation map for next iteration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method greatly outperforms all state-of-the-art unsupervised saliency detection methods and can be comparable to the current best strongly-supervised methods training with thousands of pixel-level saliency map annotations on all public benchmarks."

Harvesting such localizations from existing datasets allows for the creation of improved data sources for computer-aided diagnosis and retrospective analyses. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification and propose an attention mining (AM) strategy to improve the model’s sensitivity or saliency to disease patterns. The intuition of AM is that once the most salient disease area is blocked or hidden from the CNN model, it will pay attention to alternative image regions, while still attempting to make correct predictions. However, the model requires to be properly constrained during AM, otherwise, it may overfit to uncorrelated image parts and forget the valuable knowledge that it has learned from the original image classification task. To alleviate such side effects, we then design a knowledge preservation (KP) loss, which minimizes the discrepancy between responses for X-ray images from the original and the updated networks. Furthermore, we modify the CNN model to include multi-scale aggregation (MSA), improving its localization ability on small-scale disease findings, e.g., lung nodules.

In computer vision, localization is a complex task which typically requires manually labeled training data such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks. Our proposed approach consists of specialized four stages which completely avoids localization ground truth and only needs panel images with power loss labels for training.

For improving localization capabilities of CNNs, we introduce a novel bi-directional input-aware fusion (BiDIAF) block that reinforces the input at different levels of CNN to learn input-specific feature maps. Our empirical study shows that BiDIAF improves the power loss prediction accuracy by about 3% and localization accuracy by about 4%.

Unfortunately these priors either require pixel-level annotations/bounding boxes, or still yield inaccurate object boundaries. Here, we propose a novel method to extract accurate masks from networks pre-trained for the task of object recognition, thus forgoing external objectness modules. We first show how foreground/background masks can be obtained from the activations of higher-level convolutional layers of a network. We then show how to obtain multi-class masks by the fusion of foreground/background ones with information extracted from a weakly-supervised localization network.

The OPG is trained by using image-level annotations alone, which performs in an iterative manner to localize potential objects in a given image robustly and efficiently. In particular, we first extract an OPG map to reveal the contributions of individual pixels to a given object category, upon which an iterative mining scheme is further introduced to extract instances or components of this object. Moreover, a novel average and max pooling layer is introduced to improve the localization accuracy. In the task of weakly supervised object localization, the OPG achieves a state-of-the-art 44.5% top-5 error on ILSVRC 2013, which outperforms competing methods, including Oquab et al. and region-based convolutional neural networks on the Pascal VOC 2012, with gains of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. In the task of object detection, OPG achieves a comparable performance of 27.0% mean average precision on Pascal VOC 2007.

To reconcile this contradiction, we train a detector by driving a series of classifiers to find new actionness clips progressively, via step-by-step erasion from a complete video. During the test phase, all we need to do is to collect detection results from the one-by-one trained classifiers at various erasing steps. To assist in the collection process, a fully connected conditional random field is established to refine the temporal localization outputs. We evaluate our approach on two prevailing datasets, THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet. The experiments show that our detector advances state-of-the-art weakly supervised temporal action detection results, and even compares with quite a few strongly supervised methods."

Its benefits come with various negative consequences. One major concern is the prevalence of detrimental online behavior on social media, such as online harassment and cyberbullying. In this study, we aim to address the computational challenges associated with harassment detection in social media by developing a machine learning framework with three distinguishing characteristics. (1) It uses minimal supervision in the form of expert-provided key phrases that are indicative of bullying or non-bullying. (2) It detects harassment with an ensemble of two learners that co-train one another; one learner examines the language content in the message, and the other learner considers the social structure. (3) It incorporates distributed word and graph-node representations by training nonlinear deep models. The model is trained by optimizing an objective function that balances a co-training loss with a weak-supervision loss. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using post-hoc, crowdsourced annotation of Twitter, Ask.fm, and Instagram data, finding that our deep ensembles outperform previous non-deep methods for weakly supervised harassment detection."

We also introduce a new database, IconArt, on which we perform detection experiments on classes that could not be learned on photographs, such as Jesus Child or Saint Sebastian. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first experiments dealing with the automatic (and in our case weakly supervised) detection of iconographic elements in paintings.

Our approach only needs to modify the input image and can work with any network to improve its performance. During testing, it does not need to hide any patches. The main advantage of Hide-and-Seek over existing data augmentation techniques is its ability to improve object localization accuracy in the weakly-supervised setting, and we therefore use this task to motivate the approach. However, Hide-and-Seek is not tied only to the image localization task, and can generalize to other forms of visual input like videos, as well as other recognition tasks like image classification, temporal action localization, semantic segmentation, emotion recognition, age/gender estimation, and person re-identification. We perform extensive experiments to showcase the advantage of Hide-and-Seek on these various visual recognition problems."

Many current methods adopt the “localization by classification” framework: first do video classification, then locate temporal area contributing to the results most. However, this framework fails to locate the entire action instances and gives little consideration to the local context. In this paper, we present a novel architecture called Cascaded Pyramid Mining Network (CPMN) to address these issues using two effective modules. First, to discover the entire temporal interval of specific action, we design a two-stage cascaded module with proposed Online Adversarial Erasing (OAE) mechanism, where new and complementary regions are mined through feeding the erased feature maps of discovered regions back to the system. Second, to exploit hierarchical contextual information in videos and reduce missing detections, we design a pyramid module which produces a scale-invariant attention map through combining the feature maps from different levels. Final, we aggregate the results of two modules to perform action localization via locating high score areas in temporal Class Activation Sequence (CAS). Extensive experiments conducted on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

Currently CLE is capable of image display only and lacks an automatic system to aid the surgeon in diagnostically analyzing the images. The goal of this project was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic approach for CLE imaging of human glioma with feature localization function. Despite the tremendous progress in object detection and image segmentation methods in recent years, most of such methods require large annotated datasets for training. However, manual annotation of thousands of histopathology images by physicians is costly and time consuming. To overcome this problem, we constructed a Weakly-Supervised Learning (WSL)-based model for feature localization that trains on image-level annotations, and then localizes incidences of a class-of-interest in the test image. We developed a novel convolutional neural network for diagnostic features localization from CLE images by employing a novel multiscale activation map that is laterally inhibited and collaterally integrated. To validate our method, we compared the model output to the manual annotation performed by four neurosurgeons on test images. The model achieved 88% mean accuracy and 86% mean intersection over union on intermediate features and 87% mean accuracy and 88% mean intersection over union on restrictive fine features, while outperforming other state of the art methods tested.

Methods HRCT scans of controls and of COPD patients with diverse disease severity are acquired at two different centers. Textural features from co-occurrence matrices and Gaussian filter banks are used to characterize the lung parenchyma in the scans. Two robust versions of multiple instance learning (MIL) classifiers that can handle weakly labeled data, miSVM and MILES, are investigated. Weak labels give information relative to the emphysema without indicating the location of the lesions. The classifiers are trained with the weak labels extracted from the forced expiratory volume in one minute (FEV1) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). At test time, the classifiers output a patient label indicating overall COPD diagnosis and local labels indicating the presence of emphysema. The classifier performance is compared with manual annotations made by two radiologists, a classical density based method, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Results The miSVM classifier performed better than MILES on both patient and emphysema classification. The classifier has a stronger correlation with PFT than the density based method, the percentage of emphysema in the intersection of annotations from both radiologists, and the percentage of emphysema annotated by one of the radiologists. The correlation between the classifier and the PFT is only outperformed by the second radiologist. Conclusions The presented method uses MIL classifiers to automatically identify emphysema regions in HRCT scans. Furthermore, this approach has been demonstrated to correlate better with DLCO than a classical density based method or a radiologist, which is known to be affected in emphysema. Therefore, it is relevant to facilitate assessment of emphysema and to reduce inter-observer variability."

First, the probabilistic contribution of each image region to the confidence of a convolutional neural network-based image classifier is computed through a backtracking strategy to produce TD saliency. From a set of saliency maps of an image produced by fast bottom–up (BU) saliency approaches, we select the best saliency map suitable for the TD task. The selected BU saliency map is combined with the TD saliency map. Features having high combined saliency are used to train a linear SVM classifier to estimate feature saliency. This is integrated with combined saliency and further refined through a multi-scale superpixel averaging of saliency map. We evaluate the performance of the proposed weakly supervised TD saliency and achieve comparable performance with FS approaches.

Toward this end, we introduce a convolutional neural network based weakly supervised self-paced segmentation (WSSS) method to 1) generate the initial lesion segmentation on the axial RECIST-slice; 2) learn the data distribution on RECIST-slices; 3) adapt to segment the whole volume slice by slice to finally obtain a volumetric segmentation.

To alleviate such limitations, we propose simple yet effective regularization techniques, weight reinitialization and labeling perturbations, which prevent overfitting to noisy labels by forgetting biased weights.

For WSVOS, the algorithm is just aware of rough category information rather than the concrete object size and location cues, besides it lacks reliable annotated exemplars to learn temporal evolution in the investigated videos. Basically, there are three challenging factors which may influence the performance of WSVOS: foreground object discovery in each frame, coarse object semantic consistency within each video, and fine-grained segmentation smoothness within neighbor frames. In this paper, we establish a semantic ranking and optical warping network to simultaneously solve these three challenges in a unified framework. For the first challenge, we apply the still image saliency detection method and discover the foreground object for each frame via a segmentation network. Due to the huge discrepancies between the image saliency and the video object segmentation, we step further and propose two subnetworks to solve the other two challenges. For the second one, we propose an attentive semantic ranking subnetwork to mine video-level tags, which can learn discriminative features for semantic ranking and lead to semantic consistent segmentation masks. For the third one, we propose an optical flow warping subnetwork to constrain fine-grained segmentation smoothness within neighbor frames, which can suppress the large deformation and thus obtain smooth object boundaries for adjacent frames.

In this paper, we propose a joint framework to solve the SED task using large-scale unlabeled in-domain data. In particular, a state-of-the-art general audio tagging model is first employed to predict weak labels for unlabeled data. On the other hand, a weakly supervised architecture based on the convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) is developed to solve the strong annotations of sound events with the aid of the unlabeled data with predicted labels.

First algorithm is a simple Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) trained to classify object in- stances. We use the property of FCN to return a mask for images larger than training images to get a primary out- put segmentation mask during test time by passing an im- age pyramid to it. We enhance the FCN output mask into final output bounding boxes by a Convolutional Encoder- Decoder (ConvAE) viz. the second algorithm. ConvAE is trained to localize objects on an artificially generated dataset of output segmentation masks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in localizing objects in grocery shelves where annotating data for object detection is hard due to variety of objects. This method can be extended to any problem domain where collecting images of objects is easy and annotating their coordinates is hard.

To avoid this problem, we propose to train this kind of network from existing datasets by dividing this task into change detection and semantic extraction. On the other hand, the difference in camera viewpoints, for example images of the same scene captured from a vehicle-mounted camera at different time points, usually brings a challenge to the change detection task. To address this challenge, we propose a new siamese network structure with the introduction of correlation layer.

In this paper, we aim to develop a single neural network without resorting to any external models. We propose a novel self-guided strategy to fully utilize features learned across multiple levels to progressively generate the dense pseudo labels. First, we use high-level features as class-specific localization maps to roughly locate the classes. Next, we propose an affinity-guided method to encourage each localization map to be consistent with their intermediate level features. Third, we adopt the training image itself as guidance and propose a self-guided refinement to further transfer the image's inherent structure into the maps. Finally, we derive pseudo pixel-level labels from these localization maps and use the pseudo labels as ground truth to train the semantic segmentation model. Our proposed self-guided strategy is a unified framework, which is built on a single network and alternatively updates the feature representation and refines localization maps during the training procedure.

A fully convolutional neural network architecture is applied in which the network learns one filter per object class. The resulting feature map indicates the location of objects in an image, yielding an intuitive representation of a class activation map. While traditionally such networks are learned by a softmax or binary logistic regression (sigmoid cross-entropy loss), a learning approach based on a cosine loss is introduced. A pointwise mutual information layer is incorporated in the network in order to project predictions and ground truth presence labels in a non-categorical embedding space. Thus, the cosine loss can be employed in this non-categorical representation. Besides integrating image level annotations, it is shown how to integrate point-wise annotations using a Spatial Pyramid Pooling layer. The approach is evaluated on the VOC2012 dataset for classification, point localization and weakly supervised bounding box localization. It is shown that the combination of pointwise mutual information and a cosine loss eases the learning process and thus improves the accuracy. The integration of coarse point-wise localizations further improves the results at minimal annotation costs."

Our main contribution is a multi-fold multiple instance learning procedure, which prevents training from prematurely locking onto erroneous object locations. This procedure is particularly important when using high-dimensional representations, such as Fisher vectors and convolutional neural network features.

Training such a DCNN usually relies on a large number of images with pixel-level segmentation masks, and annotating these images is very costly in terms of both finance and human effort. In this paper, we propose a simple to complex (STC) framework in which only image-level annotations are utilized to learn DCNNs for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first train an initial segmentation network called Initial-DCNN with the saliency maps of simple images (i.e., those with a single category of major object(s) and clean background). These saliency maps can be automatically obtained by existing bottom-up salient object detection techniques, where no supervision information is needed. Then, a better network called Enhanced-DCNN is learned with supervision from the predicted segmentation masks of simple images based on the Initial-DCNN as well as the image-level annotations. Finally, more pixel-level segmentation masks of complex images (two or more categories of objects with cluttered background), which are inferred by using Enhanced-DCNN and image-level annotations, are utilized as the supervision information to learn the Powerful-DCNN for semantic segmentation. Our method utilizes 40K simple images from Flickr.com and 10K complex images from PASCAL VOC for step-wisely boosting the segmentation network.

An online supportive sample harvesting scheme is further proposed to dynamically select the most confident tight positive samples and train the detector in a mutual boosting way. To prevent the detector from being trapped in poor optima due to overfitting, we propose a new relative improvement of predicted CNN scores for guiding the self-taught learning process. Extensive experiments on PASCAL 2007 and 2012 show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts, strongly validating its effectiveness."

Object proposal is an effective component in localization, but often computationally expensive and incapable of joint optimization with some of the remaining modules. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we for the first time integrate weakly supervised object proposal into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end learning manner. We design a network component, Soft Proposal (SP), to be plugged into any standard convolutional architecture to introduce the nearly cost-free object proposal, orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods. In the SP-augmented CNNs, referred to as Soft Proposal Networks (SPNs), iteratively evolved object proposals are generated based on the deep feature maps then projected back, and further jointly optimized with network parameters, with image-level supervision only. Through the unified learning process, SPNs learn better object-centric filters, discover more discriminative visual evidence, and suppress background interference, significantly boosting both weakly supervised object localization and classification performance. We report the best results on popular benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ImageNet."

This is motivated by the fact that it is extremely expensive to label the combinatorial relations between objects at the instance level. Compared to the extensively studied problem, Weakly Supennsed Object Detection (WSOD), WSVRD is more challenging as it needs to examine a large set of regions pairs, which is computationally prohibitive and more likely stuck in a local optimal solution such as those involving wrong spatial context. To this end, we present a Parallel, Pairwise Region-based, Fully Convolutional Network (PPR-FCN) for WSVRD. It uses a parallel FCN architecture that simultaneously performs pair selection and classification of single regions and region pairs for object and relation detection, while sharing almost all computation shared over the entire image. In particular, we propose a novel position-role-sensitive score map with pairwise RoI pooling to efficiently capture the crucial context associated with a pair of objects.

Our goal is to overcome this limitation with no additional human intervention by retrieving videos relevant to target class labels from web repository, and generating segmentation labels from the retrieved videos to simulate strong supervision for semantic segmentation. During this process, we take advantage of image classification with discriminative localization technique to reject false alarms in retrieved videos and identify relevant spatio-temporal volumes within retrieved videos. Although the entire procedure does not require any additional supervision, the segmentation annotations obtained from videos are sufficiently strong to learn a model for semantic segmentation. The proposed algorithm substantially outperforms existing methods based on the same level of supervision and is even as competitive as the approaches relying on extra annotations."

In the second step, the activations on the most salient parts are suppressed by inference conditional feedback, and then the second learning is performed to find the area of the next most important parts. By combining the activations of both phases, the entire portion of the target object can be captured.

The second approach is to project distributed representations of words (word embeddings) from a target language to a source language, so that the source-language NER system can be applied to the target language without re-training.

The underlying idea is that adding large fake visual data forces real samples to be close in the feature space, enabling a bottom-up clustering process, which, in turn, improves multiclass pixel classification. To ensure higher quality of generated images for GANs with consequent improved pixel classification, we extend the above framework by adding weakly annotated data, i.e., we provide class level information to the generator.

This phenomenon is creating a need for automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting such behaviors. We propose a machine learning method for simultaneously inferring user roles in harassment-based bullying and new vocabulary indicators of bullying. The learning algorithm considers social structure and infers which users tend to bully and which tend to be victimized. To address the elusive nature of cyberbullying, the learning algorithm only requires weak supervision. Experts provide a small seed vocabulary of bullying indicators, and the algorithm uses a large, unlabeled corpus of social media interactions to extract bullying roles of users and additional vocabulary indicators of bullying. The model estimates whether each social interaction is bullying based on who participates and based on what language is used, and it tries to maximize the agreement between these estimates, i.e., participant-vocabulary consistency (PVC). We evaluate PVC on three social media data sets, demonstrating quantitatively and qualitatively its effectiveness in cyberbullying detection."

Most of the datasets are weakly labelled, which means only the tags of the clip are known, without knowing the occurrence time of the tags. The labeling of an audio clip is often based on the audio events in the clip and no event level label is provided to the user. Previous works have used the bag of frames model assume the tags occur all the time, which is not the case in practice. We propose a joint detection-classification (JDC) model to detect and classify the audio clip simultaneously. The JDC model has the ability to attend to informative and ignore uninformative sounds. Then only informative regions are used for classification. Experimental results on the “CHiME Home” dataset show that the JDC model reduces the equal error rate (EER) from 19.0% to 16.9%. More interestingly, the audio event detector is trained successfully without needing the event level label."

One promising source of recordings of audio events is the large amount of multimedia data on the web. In particular, if the audio content analysis must itself be performed on web audio, it is important to train the recognizers themselves from such data. Training from these web data, however, poses several challenges, the most important being the availability of labels : labels, if any, that may be obtained for the data are generally {\em weak}, and not of the kind conventionally required for training detectors or classifiers. We propose that learning algorithms that can exploit weak labels offer an effective method to learn from web data. We then propose a robust and efficient deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework to learn audio event recognizers from weakly labeled data. The proposed method can train from and analyze recordings of variable length in an efficient manner and outperforms a network trained with {\em strongly labeled} web data by a considerable margin."

However, current methods for detailed understanding of actor and action have significant limitations: they require large amounts of finely labeled data, and they fail to capture any internal relationship among actors and actions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel, robust multi-task ranking model for weakly supervised actor-action segmentation where only video-level tags are given for training samples. Our model is able to share useful information among different actors and actions while learning a ranking matrix to select representative supervoxels for actors and actions respectively. Final segmentation results are generated by a conditional random field that considers various ranking scores for different video parts.

Once learned, given an image, our model can be deployed to tackle a number of vision problems in a joint and coherent manner, including recognising objects in the scene (automatic object annotation), describing objects using their attributes (attribute prediction and association), and localising and delineating the objects (object detection and semantic segmentation). This is achieved by developing a novel Weakly Supervised Markov Random Field Stacked Indian Buffet Process (WS-MRF-SIBP) that models objects and attributes as latent factors and explicitly captures their correlations within and across superpixels.

We focus on the following three aspects of EM: (i) initialization; (ii) latent posterior estimation (E-step) and (iii) the parameter update (M-step). We show that saliency and attention maps, bottom-up and top-down cues respectively, of images with single objects (simple images) provide highly reliable cues to learn an initialization for the EM. Intuitively, given weak supervisions, we first learn to segment simple images and then move towards the complex ones. Next, for updating the parameters (M step), we propose to minimize the combination of the standard softmax loss and the KL divergence between the latent posterior distribution (obtained using the E-step) and the likelihood given by the cnn. This combination is more robust to wrong predictions made by the E step of the EM algorithm. Extensive experiments and discussions show that our method is very simple and intuitive, and outperforms the state-of-the-art method with a very high margin of 3.7% and 3.9% on the PASCAL VOC12 train and test sets respectively, thus setting new state-of-the-art results."

On top of the initial CNN activations, we define a CRF model to incorporate the local differences and context with the dense connections between individual pixels. We apply a constrained mean-field algorithm to estimate the pixel-level labels, and use the estimated labels to update the parameters of the CNN in an iterative EM framework. This enables imposing global constraints on the observed foreground probability mass function. Our evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate superior detection and localization performance."

This makes weak supervision attractive, using weak or noisy signals like the output of heuristic methods or user click-through data for training. In a semi-supervised setting, we can use a large set of data with weak labels to pretrain a neural network and then fine-tune the parameters with a small amount of data with true labels. This feels intuitively sub-optimal as these two independent stages leave the model unaware about the varying label quality. What if we could somehow inform the model about the label quality? In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method where we train two neural networks in a multi-task fashion: a ""target network"" and a ""confidence network"". The target network is optimized to perform a given task and is trained using a large set of unlabeled data that are weakly annotated. We propose to weight the gradient updates to the target network using the scores provided by the second confidence network, which is trained on a small amount of supervised data. Thus we avoid that the weight updates computed from noisy labels harm the quality of the target network model.

A typical approach to WSOD is to 1) generate a series of region proposals for each image and assign the image-level label to all the proposals in that image; 2) train a classifier using all the proposals; and 3) use the classifier to select proposals with high confidence scores as the positive instances for another round of training. In this way, the image-level labels are iteratively transferred to instance-level labels. We aim to resolve the following two fundamental problems within this paradigm. First, existing proposal generation algorithms are not yet robust, thus the object proposals are often inaccurate. Second, the selected positive instances are sometimes noisy and unreliable, which hinders the training at subsequent iterations. We adopt two separate neural networks, one to focus on each problem, to better utilize the specific characteristic of region proposal refinement and positive instance selection. Further, to leverage the mutual benefits of the two tasks, the two neural networks are jointly trained and reinforced iteratively in a progressive manner, starting with easy and reliable instances and then gradually incorporating difficult ones at a later stage when the selection classifier is more robust.

Weakly supervised approaches tackle this issue by leveraging weak annotations such as image-level labels and bounding boxes, which are either readily available in existing large-scale data sets for image classification and object detection or easily obtained thanks to their low annotation costs. The main challenge in weakly supervised semantic segmentation then is the incomplete annotations that miss accurate object boundary information required to learn segmentation.

The primary problem domain focus of this paper is acoustic event and scene detection in audio recordings. We first propose a naive formulation for leveraging labeled data in both forms. We then propose a more general framework for Supervised and Weakly Supervised Learning (SWSL). Based on this general framework, we propose a graph based approach for SWSL.

Second, we propose learning of the latent class label of each candidate window as a binary classification problem, by training category-specific classifiers used to coarsely classify a candidate window into either a target object or a nontarget class.

Training such a DCNN usually relies on a large number of images with pixel-level segmentation masks, and annotating these images is very costly in terms of both finance and human effort. In this paper, we propose a simple to complex (STC) framework in which only image-level annotations are utilized to learn DCNNs for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first train an initial segmentation network called Initial-DCNN with the saliency maps of simple images (i.e., those with a single category of major object(s) and clean background). These saliency maps can be automatically obtained by existing bottom-up salient object detection techniques, where no supervision information is needed. Then, a better network called Enhanced-DCNN is learned with supervision from the predicted segmentation masks of simple images based on the Initial-DCNN as well as the image-level annotations. Finally, more pixel-level segmentation masks of complex images (two or more categories of objects with cluttered background), which are inferred by using Enhanced-DCNN and image-level annotations, are utilized as the supervision information to learn the Powerful-DCNN for semantic segmentation. Our method utilizes 40K simple images from Flickr.com and 10K complex images from PASCAL VOC for step-wisely boosting the segmentation network.

In particular, two challenging problems need to be solved when learning robust classifiers, in which the first issue is to cope with the label noise of training Web data from the source domain, while the second issue is to enhance the generalization capability of learned classifiers to an arbitrary target domain. In order to handle the first problem, the training samples within each category are partitioned into clusters, where we use one bag to denote each cluster and instances to denote the samples in each cluster. Then, we identify a proportion of good training samples in each bag and train robust classifiers by using the good training samples, which leads to a multi-instance learning (MIL) problem. In order to handle the second problem, we assume that the training samples possibly form a set of hidden domains, with each hidden domain associated with a distinctive data distribution. Then, for each category and each hidden latent domain, we propose to learn one classifier by extending our MIL formulation, which leads to our WSDG approach. In the testing stage, our approach can obtain better generalization capability by effectively integrating multiple classifiers from different latent domains in each category. Moreover, our WSDG approach is further extended to utilize additional textual descriptions associated with Web data as privileged information (PI), although testing data do not have such PI.

The proposed framework is composed of two deep modules, an image-level classifier and a pixel-level map generator. While the former distinguishes images with objects of interest from the rest, the latter is learned to generate saliency maps so that the training images masked by the maps can be better predicted by the former. In addition to the top-down guidance from class labels, the map generator is derived by also referring to other image information, including the background prior, area balance and spatial consensus. This information greatly regularizes the training process and reduces the risk of overfitting, especially when learning deep models with few training data.

Wang,b0f2ab1f186aac838b44fd1f3fcd773830daab40,Polyphonic Sound Event Detection with Weak Labeling,,2017.0,14,"Sound event detection (SED) is the task of detecting the type as well as the onset and offset times of sound events in audio streams. It is useful for multimedia retrieval, surveillance, etc. SED is difficult because sound events exhibit diverse temporal and spectral characteristics, and because they can overlap with each other. Ideally, SED systems should be trained with strong labeling, which provides the type, onset time and offset time of each sound event occurrence. However, such labeling is formidably tedious to produce by hand. Current research on SED often uses weak labeling. This thesis deals with two types of weak labeling: presence/absence labeling, which only states which types of events are present in each recording without any temporal information, and sequential labeling, which only provides the order of sound events, but without timestamps. Even if the training data is weakly labeled, we still want our SED systems to localize the sound events in time. SED with presence/absence labeling is usually treated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, which requires a pooling function. In this thesis, we compare six pooling functions both theoretically and empirically, and establish the linear softmax pooling function as the optimal. Using this function, we build a state-of-the-art network that not only recognizes the types of sound events, but also localizes them temporally. SED with sequential labeling has not received much attention. In this thesis, we propose a novel connectionist temporal localization (CTL) framework, which successfully makes use of the extra temporal information in sequential labeling compared with presence/absence labeling. Transfer learning is a popular technique to deal with insufficient training data. In this thesis we extract features from two neural networks trained for out-of-domain tasks, and show that these features can improve the SED performance when the training corpus is small."

However, the computational cost of generating and evaluating region proposals is heavy. We adapt the concept of Class Activation Maps (CAM) into the very first weakly-supervised 'single-shot' detector that does not require the use of region proposals. To facilitate this, we propose a novel global pooling technique called Spatial Pyramid Averaged Max (SPAM) pooling for training this CAM-based network for object extent localisation with only weak image-level supervision. We show this global pooling layer possesses a near ideal flow of gradients for extent localization, that offers a good trade-off between the extremes of max and average pooling. Our approach only requires a single network pass and uses a fast-backprojection technique, completely omitting any region proposal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to do so. Due to this, we are able to perform inference in real-time at 35fps, which is an order of magnitude faster than all previous weakly supervised object localization frameworks."

We propose framCNN, a novel weakly-supervised learning framework that improves the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) for acoustic event detection by attending to details of each sound at various temporal levels. Most existing weaklysupervised frameworks replace fully-connected network with global average pooling after the final convolution layer. Such a method tends to identify only a few discriminative parts, leading to suboptimal localization and classification accuracy. The key idea of our approach is to consciously classify the sound of each frame given by the corresponding label. The idea is general and can be applied to any network for achieving sound event detection and improving the performance of sound event classification. In acoustic scene classification (Task1), our approach obtained an average accuracy of 99.2% on the four-fold cross-validation for acoustic scene recognition, comparing to the provided baseline of 74.8%.

Three aspects, such as shape similarity-based cosegmentation, shape matching-based part detection and segmentation, and graph matching-based part assignment are considered. A part segmentation energy function is first proposed. Four terms, such as MRF-based single image segmentation term, shape feature-based foreground consistency term, NCuts-based part segmentation term, and two-order graphs matching based part consistency term, are contained. Then, a three sub-minimization-based energy minimization method is proposed to accomplish approximation solution. Finally, we verify our method based on three image data sets (PASCAL VOC 2008 Part data set, UCB Bird data set, and Cat-Dog data set), and one video data set (UCF Sports) data set.

With over-segmentation, this task can be transformed into multiple-instance context. However, most multiple-instance learning methods only emphasize single most positive instance in a positive bag to optimize bag-level classification, and leads to imprecise or incomplete localization. To address this issue, we propose a scheme for instance annotation, where all of the positive instances are detected by labeling each instance in each positive bag. Inspired by the successful application of bag-of-words (BoW) to feature representation, we leverage it at instance-level to model the distributions of the positive class and negative class, and then incorporate the BoW learning and instance labeling in a single optimization formulation. We also demonstrate that the scheme is well suited to weakly supervised object localization of irregular-shape. Experimental results validate the effectiveness both for the problem of generic instance annotation and for the application of weakly supervised object localization compared to some existing methods."

Many existing approaches tackle this problem through object proposal mining.

Moreover, training is often slow because region selection and object detector training are processed separately. In this context, the primary contribution of this work is to improve weakly supervised detection with an optimized region selection strategy. The proposed method collects purified positive training regions by progressively removing easy background clutters, and selects discriminative negative regions by mining class-specific hard samples. This region selection procedure is further integrated into a CNN-based weakly supervised detection (WSD) framework, and can be performed in each stochastic gradient descent mini-batch during training. Therefore, the entire model can be trained end-to-end efficiently. Extensive evaluation results on PASCAL VOC 2007, VOC 2010 and VOC 2012 datasets are presented which demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves WSD."

Numerous methods have been proposed to solve the problem. Recently the best results are attained by deep neural network based methods. Training such networks needs large amounts of bounding box-level or pixel-level annotated data. Generating large amounts of such data always requires huge amounts of labor which can be expensive and time consuming. In this paper we explore the utilization of weakly supervised deep neural network for generating text proposals in natural scene images. The network allows multi-scale inputs and is trained to perform whole image binary classification to tell whether an image contains text or not. After training the network acquired learning of powerful discriminated features that are capable of distinguishing text from other objects. To get the text location, text confidence score map is generated based on feature maps from the top two convolutional layers by extracting class activation map. Value of each pixel in the score map denotes the confidence score of whether the pixel belongs to text or not. By setting a threshold the score map is converted to a binary mask map. Foregrounds of the mask map are probable text areas. Then Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) are extracted from these probable text areas and are aggregated as groups. By processing these groups, text proposals are obtained. Experimental results show that without using any bounding boxes or pixel-level annotation, the algorithm achieves recall rate comparable to some fully supervised methods in ICDAR 2013 focused text dataset and In ICDAR 2015 incidental text dataset."

Visually similar objects are extracted automatically from weakly labeled videos hence bypassing the tedious process of manually annotating training data. However, the problem as applied to small or medium sized objects is still largely unexplored.

Since the object is characterized neither by its appearance nor its motion in such videos, we propose a robust framework that taps valuable human context and models similarity of objects based on appearance and functionality. Furthermore, the framework is designed such that it maximizes the utility of the data by detecting possibly multiple instances of an object from each video.

While most works in this area assume an ordered sequence of occurring actions to be given, our approach only uses a set of actions. Such action sets provide much less supervision since neither action ordering nor the number of action occurrences are known. In exchange, they can be easily obtained, for instance, from meta-tags, while ordered sequences still require human annotation.

To obtain distinct class-specific saliency maps which can be used as unary potentials of CRF, we propose a novel method to estimate class saliency maps which improves the method proposed by Simonyan et al. (2014) significantly by the following improvements: (1) using CNN derivatives with respect to feature maps of the intermediate convolutional layers with up-sampling instead of an input image; (2) subtracting the saliency maps of the other classes from the saliency maps of the target class to differentiate target objects from other objects; (3) aggregating multiple-scale class saliency maps to compensate lower resolution of the feature maps. After obtaining distinct class saliency maps, we apply fully-connected CRF by using the class maps as unary potentials. By the experiments, we show that the proposed method has outperformed state-of-the-art results with the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset under the weakly-supervised setting."

Hence, weak supervision using only image tags could have a significant impact in semantic segmentation. Recently, CNN-based methods have proposed to fine-tune pre-trained networks using image tags. Without additional information, this leads to poor localization accuracy. This problem, however, was alleviated by making use of objectness priors to generate foreground/background masks. Unfortunately these priors either require training pixel-level annotations/bounding boxes, or still yield inaccurate object boundaries. Here, we propose a novel method to extract markedly more accurate masks from the pre-trained network itself, forgoing external objectness modules. This is accomplished using the activations of the higher-level convolutional layers, smoothed by a dense CRF. We demonstrate that our method, based on these masks and a weakly-supervised loss, outperforms the state-of-the-art tag-based weakly-supervised semantic segmentation techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a new form of inexpensive weak supervision yielding an additional accuracy boost."

As a result, the past decade has seen a lot of focus on computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of lung nodules, whose goal is to efficiently detect, segment lung nodules and classify them as being benign or malignant. Effective detection of such nodules remains a challenge due to their arbitrariness in shape, size and texture. In this paper, we propose to employ 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn highly discriminative features for nodule detection in lieu of hand-engineered ones such as geometric shape or texture. While 3D CNNs are promising tools to model the spatio-temporal statistics of data, they are limited by their need for detailed 3D labels, which can be prohibitively expensive when compared obtaining 2D labels. Existing CAD methods rely on obtaining detailed labels for lung nodules, to train models, which is also unrealistic and time consuming. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a solution wherein the expert needs to provide only a point label, i.e., the central pixel of of the nodule, and its largest expected size. We use unsupervised segmentation to grow out a 3D region, which is used to train the CNN. Using experiments on the SPIE-LUNGx dataset, we show that the network trained using these weak labels can produce reasonably low false positive rates with a high sensitivity, even in the absence of accurate 3D labels."

The key problem is to simultaneously infer the exact object locations in the training images and train the object detectors, given only the training images with weak image-level labels. Intuitively, by simulating the selective attention mechanism of human visual system, saliency detection technique can select attractive objects in scenes and thus is a potential way to provide useful priors for WOD. However, the way to adopt saliency detection in WOD is not trivial since the detected saliency region might be possibly highly ambiguous in complex cases. To this end, this paper first comprehensively analyzes the challenges in applying saliency detection to WOD. Then, we make one of the earliest efforts to bridge saliency detection to WOD via the self-paced curriculum learning, which can guide the learning procedure to gradually achieve faithful knowledge of multi-class objects from easy to hard. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully bridge saliency detection and WOD tasks and achieve the state-of-the-art object detection results under the weak supervision."

We then match those regions to videos and retrieve the corresponding tracked object boxes. Finally, we design a hough transform algorithm to vote for the best box to serve as the pseudo GT for each image, and use them to train an object detector.

Especially in object localization, deep convolutional neural networks outperform traditional approaches based on extraction of data/task-driven features instead of hand-crafted features. Although location information of region-of-interests (ROIs) gives good prior for object localization, it requires heavy annotation efforts from human resources. Thus a weakly supervised framework for object localization is introduced. The term ""weakly"" means that this framework only uses image-level labeled datasets to train a network. With the help of transfer learning which adopts weight parameters of a pre-trained network, the weakly supervised learning framework for object localization performs well because the pre-trained network already has well-trained class-specific features. However, those approaches cannot be used for some applications which do not have pre-trained networks or well-localized large scale images. Medical image analysis is a representative among those applications because it is impossible to obtain such pre-trained networks.

Then, a novel WSL approach is presented to object detection where the training sets require only binary labels indicating whether an image contains the target object or not. Based on the learnt high-level features, it jointly integrates saliency, intraclass compactness, and interclass separability in a Bayesian framework to initialize a set of training examples from weakly labeled images and start iterative learning of the object detector. A novel evaluation criterion is also developed to detect model drift and cease the iterative learning. Comprehensive experiments on three optical RSI data sets have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed approach in benchmarking with several state-of-the-art supervised-learning-based object detection approaches."

Each image-level tag imposes constraints on the output labeling of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. We propose Constrained CNN (CCNN), a method which uses a novel loss function to optimize for any set of linear constraints on the output space (i.e. predicted label distribution) of a CNN. Our loss formulation is easy to optimize and can be incorporated directly into standard stochastic gradient descent optimization. The key idea is to phrase the training objective as a biconvex optimization for linear models, which we then relax to nonlinear deep networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our new learning framework. The constrained loss yields state-of-the-art results on weakly supervised semantic image segmentation. We further demonstrate that adding slightly more supervision can greatly improve the performance of the learning algorithm."

The classical approach to solve this problem is to consider the location of the object of interest in each image as a latent variable and minimize the loss generated by such latent variable during learning. However, as learning appearance and localization are two interconnected tasks, the optimization is not convex and the procedure can easily get stuck in a poor local minimum, i.e. the algorithm “misses” the object in some images. In this paper, we help the optimization to get close to the global minimum by enforcing a “soft” similarity between each possible location in the image and a reduced set of “exemplars”, or clusters, learned with a convex formulation in the training images. The help is effective because it comes from a different and smooth source of information that is not directly connected with the main task. Results show that our method improves a strong baseline based on convolutional neural network features by more than 4 points without any additional features or extra computation at testing time but only adding a small increment of the training time due to the convex clustering."

Inspired by these observations, we propose a computational model for weakly-supervised object detection, based on prior knowledge modelling, exemplar learning and learning with video contexts. The prior knowledge is modeled with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). When very few instances of a new concept are given, an initial concept detector is built by exemplar learning over the deep features the pre-trained CNN. The well-designed tracking solution is then used to discover more diverse instances from the massive online weakly labeled videos. Once a positive instance is detected/identified with high score in each video, more instances possibly from different view-angles and/or different distances are tracked and accumulated. Then the concept detector can be fine-tuned based on these new instances. This process can be repeated again and again till we obtain a very mature concept detector. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC-07/10/12 object detection datasets [9] well demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. It can beat the state-of-the-art full-training based performances by learning from very few samples for each object category, along with about 20,000 weakly labeled videos."

In our approach, a novel video segmentation-by-detection framework is proposed, which first incorporates object and region detectors pre-trained on still images to generate a set of detection and segmentation proposals. Based on the noisy proposals, several object tracks are then initialized by solving a joint binary optimization problem with min-cost flow. As such tracks actually provide rough configurations of semantic objects, we thus refine the object segmentation while preserving the spatiotemporal consistency by inferring the shape likelihoods of pixels from the statistical information of tracks.

To address the first issue, we partition the training samples in each class into multiple clusters. By treating each cluster as a “bag” and the samples in each cluster as “instances”, we formulate a multi-instance learning (MIL) problem by selecting a subset of training samples from each training bag and simultaneously learning the optimal classifiers based on the selected samples. To address the second issue, we assume the training web images/videos may come from multiple hidden domains with different data distributions. We then extend our MIL formulation to learn one classifier for each class and each latent domain such that multiple classifiers from each class can be effectively integrated to achieve better generalization capability. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach for visual recognition by learning from web data."

Due to the cluttered image condition, objects usually have large ambiguity with backgrounds. Besides, there is also a lack of effective algorithm for large-scale weakly supervised localization in cluttered backgrounds. However, backgrounds contain useful latent information, e.g., the sky in the aeroplane class. If this latent information can be learned, object-background ambiguity can be largely reduced and background can be suppressed effectively. In this paper, we propose the latent category learning (LCL) in large-scale cluttered conditions. LCL is an unsupervised learning method which requires only image-level class labels. First, we use the latent semantic analysis with semantic object representation to learn the latent categories, which represent objects, object parts or backgrounds.

A community-driven graph is then constructed that captures spatial and feature relationships between communities while a label graph captures correlations between image labels. Finally, mapping the image level labels to appropriate communities is formulated as a convex optimization problem.

Training such models, however, requires expensive pixel-wise annotations of salient objects. Moreover, many existing salient object detection models assume that at least a salient object exists in the input image. Such an impractical assumption leads to less appealing saliency maps on the background images, which contain no salient objects at all. 
To avoid expensive strong saliency annotations, in this paper, we study weakly supervised learning approaches for salient object detection. In specific, given a set of background images and/or salient object images, where we only have annotations of salient object existence, we propose two approaches to train salient object detection models. In the first approach, we train a one-class SVM based on background superpixels. The further a superpixel is from the decision boundary of the one-class SVM, the more salient it is. The most interesting property of this approach is that we can effortlessly synthesize a set of background images to train the model. In the second approach, we present a solution toward jointly addressing salient object existence and detection tasks. We formulate salient object detection as an image labeling problem, where saliency labels of superpixels are modeled as hidden variables in the latent structural SVM framework. Experimental results on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches."

We follow a multiple-instance learning approach that iteratively trains the detector and infers the object locations in the positive training images. Our main contribution is a multi-fold multiple instance learning procedure, which prevents training from prematurely locking onto erroneous object locations. This procedure is particularly important when high-dimensional representations, such as the Fisher vectors, are used. We present a detailed experimental evaluation using the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.

In particular, we first extract graphlets from each image, where a graphlet is a small-sized graph measures the potential of multiple spatially neighboring superpixels (i.e., the probability of these superpixels sharing a common semantic label, such as the sky or the sea). To compare different-sized graphlets and to incorporate image-level labels, a manifold embedding algorithm is designed to transform all graphlets into equal-length feature vectors. Finally, we present a hierarchical Bayesian network to capture the semantic associations between postembedding graphlets, based on which the semantics of each superpixel is inferred accordingly.

For each image, to extract a reliable bounding box as this root filter estimate, we explore the generic objectness measurement to obtain a reference window based on the most salient region, and select a small set of candidate windows by adaptive thresholding and greedy Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). The initial root filter estimate is decided by optimizing the score of overlap between the reference box and candidate boxes, as well as their corresponding objectness score. Then the derived window is treated as a positive training window for DPM training. Finally, we design a flexible enlarging-and-shrinking post-processing procedure to modify the output of DPM, which can effectively fit to the aspect ratio of the object and further improve the final accuracy. Experimental results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 database demonstrate that our proposed framework is effective and competitive with the state-of-the-arts."

For such a problem, the goal is to predict the locations of objects in test images while the labels of the training images are given at image-level. That means a label only indicates whether an image contains objects or not, but does not provide the exact locations of the objects. We propose to address this problem using Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW). Specifically, we first train a linear SVM classifier with the weakly labeled data. Based on bag-of-words feature representation, the response of a region to the linear SVM classifier can be formulated as the sum of the feature-weights within the region. For a test image, by properly constructing a graph on the feature-points, the stationary distribution of a MERW can indicate the region with the densest positive feature-weights, and thus provides a probabilistic object localization. Experiments compared with state-of-the-art methods on two datasets validate the performance of our method."

Then, a manifold embedding algorithm is proposed to transform graph lets of different sizes into equal-length feature vectors.

Unfortunately, most such attempts are doomed because traditional approaches are ill-suited, both in terms of their computational characteristics and their inability to robustly contend with the label noise that plagues uncurated Internet content. We present CRANE, a weakly supervised algorithm that is specifically designed to learn under such conditions. First, we exploit the asymmetric availability of real-world training data, where small numbers of positive videos tagged with the concept are supplemented with large quantities of unreliable negative data. Second, we ensure that CRANE is robust to label noise, both in terms of tagged videos that fail to contain the concept as well as occasional negative videos that do. Finally, CRANE is highly parallelizable, making it practical to deploy at large scale without sacrificing the quality of the learned solution. Although CRANE is general, this paper focuses on segment annotation, where we show state-of-the-art pixel-level segmentation results on two datasets, one of which includes a training set of spatiotemporal segments from more than 20,000 videos."

The proposed approach is motivated from the observation that super pixels belonging to an object class usually exist across multiple images and hence can be gathered via the idea of clustering. In WSDC, spectral clustering is adopted to cluster the super pixels obtained from a set of over-segmented images. At the same time, a linear transformation between features and labels as a kind of discriminative clustering is learned to select the discriminative features among different classes. The both clustering outputs should be consistent as much as possible. Besides, weakly-supervised constraints from image-level labels are imposed to restrict the labeling of super pixels. Finally, the non-convex and non-smooth objective function are efficiently optimized using an iterative CCCP procedure. Extensive experiments conducted on MSRC and Label Me datasets demonstrate the encouraging performance of our method in comparison with some state-of-the-arts."

Previous pain vs no-pain systems have highlighted two major challenges: (1) ground truth is provided for the sequence, but the presence or absence of the target expression for a given frame is unknown, and (2) the time point and the duration of the pain expression event(s) in each video are unknown. To address these issues we propose a novel framework (referred to as MS-MIL) where each sequence is represented as a bag containing multiple segments, and multiple instance learning (MIL) is employed to handle this weakly labeled data in the form of sequence level ground-truth. These segments are generated via multiple clustering of a sequence or running a multi-scale temporal scanning window, and are represented using a state-of-the-art Bag of Words (BoW) representation. This work extends the idea of detecting facial expressions through `concept frames' to `concept segments' and argues through extensive experiments that algorithms like MIL are needed to reap the benefits of such representation. The key advantages of our approach are: (1) joint detection and localization of painful frames using only sequence-level ground-truth, (2) incorporation of temporal dynamics by representing the data not as individual frames but as segments, and (3) extraction of multiple segments, which is well suited to signals with uncertain temporal location and duration in the video. Experiments on UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain dataset highlight the effectiveness of our approach by achieving promising results on the problem of pain detection in videos."

(ii) Attribute association. The scene attributes contain nouns and adjectives corresponding to the objects and their appearance descriptions respectively.

In this paper we develop a new way of evaluating classification models for semantic segmentation given weekly supervised labels. For a certain category, provided the classification model parameter, we firstly learn the basis superpixels by sparse reconstruction, and then evaluate the parameters by measuring the reconstruction errors among negative and positive superpixels. Based on Gaussian Mixture Models, we use Iterative Merging Update (IMU) algorithm to obtain the best parameters for the classification models.

This study aims to combine the comparative advantages of both kinds of approaches, and its contributions are two-fold: (i) a weakly supervised approach for object detection, which does not require manual collection and labelling of training samples; (ii) an extension of Boosting algorithm denoted as Soft-Label Boosting, which is able to employ training samples with soft (probabilistic) labels instead of hard (binary) labels.

We present a novel approach that can cope with extensive clutter as well as large scale and appearance variations between object instances. To make this possible we exploit generic knowledge learned beforehand from images of other classes for which location annotation is available. Generic knowledge facilitates learning any new class from weakly supervised images, because it reduces the uncertainty in the location of its object instances. We propose a conditional random field that starts from generic knowledge and then progressively adapts to the new class. Our approach simultaneously localizes object instances while learning an appearance model specific for the class. We demonstrate this on several datasets, including the very challenging Pascal VOC 2007. Furthermore, our method allows training any state-of-the-art object detector in a weakly supervised fashion, although it would normally require object location annotations."

However, it is difficult to assess the relative usefulness of different visual cues from weakly supervised training data. We define a parametric family of structured models, were each model weights visual cues in a different way. We propose a Maximum Expected Agreement model selection principle that evaluates the quality of a model from the family without looking at superpixel labels. Searching for the best model is a hard optimization problem, which has no analytic gradient and multiple local optima. We cast it as a Bayesian optimization problem and propose an algorithm based on Gaussian processes to efficiently solve it. Our second contribution is an Extremely Randomized Hashing Forest that represents diverse superpixel features as a sparse binary vector. It enables using appearance models of visual classes that are fast at training and testing and yet accurate.

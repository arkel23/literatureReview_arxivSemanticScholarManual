Existing techniques have focused on exploiting either the static nature of sketches with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or the temporal sequential property with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this work, we propose a new representation of sketches as multiple sparsely connected graphs. We design a novel graph neural network (GNN), the multigraph transformer (MGT), for learning representations of sketches from multiple graphs, which simultaneously capture global and local geometric stroke structures as well as temporal information. We report extensive numerical experiments on a sketch recognition task to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. Particularly, MGT applied on 414k sketches from Google QuickDraw: 1) achieves a small recognition gap to the CNN-based performance upper bound (72.80% versus 74.22%) and infers faster than the CNN competitors and 2) outperforms all RNN-based models by a significant margin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing to represent sketches as graphs and apply GNNs for sketch recognition.

Given a 3D bust model as reference, our sketching system takes as input a user-drawn sketch (consisting of hair contour and a few strokes indicating the hair growing direction within a hair region), and automatically generates a 3D hair model, matching the input sketch. The key enablers of our system are three carefully designed neural networks, namely, S2ONet, which converts an input sketch to a dense 2D hair orientation field; O2VNet, which maps the 2D orientation field to a 3D vector field; and V2VNet, which updates the 3D vector field with respect to the new sketches, enabling hair editing with additional sketches in new views. All the three networks are trained with synthetic data generated from a 3D hairstyle database. We demonstrate the effectiveness and expressiveness of our tool using a variety of hairstyles and also compare our method with prior art."

This importantly addresses a common problem faced by the sketch community – that annotated supervisory data are difficult to obtain. This problem is very challenging in which sketches are highly abstract and subject to different drawing styles, making existing solutions tailored for photos unsuitable. Key for the success of our self-supervised learning paradigm lies with our sketch-specific designs: (i) we propose a set of pretext tasks specifically designed for sketches that mimic different drawing styles, and (ii) we further exploit the use of the textual convolution network (TCN) together with the convolutional neural network (CNN) in a dual-branch architecture for sketch feature learning, as means to accommodate the sequential stroke nature of sketches. We demonstrate the superiority of our sketch-specific designs through two sketch-related applications (retrieval and recognition) on a million-scale sketch dataset, and show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised representation learning methods, and significantly narrows the performance gap between with supervised representation learning.11PyTorch code of this work is available at https://github.com/zzz1515151/self-supervised_learning_sketch."

Moreover, iterations of such models can be time-consuming tasks and sometimes limiting depending on the the design stage, as major changes in the layout design may result in remodeling the entire parametric definition. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel automated generative design system, which takes a basic floor plan sketch as an input and provides a parametric model prepared for multi-objective building optimization as output. In addition, the user-designer can assign various design variables for its desired building elements by using simple annotations in the drawing. We take advantage of a asymmetric convolutional module combined with a parametrizer to allow real-time parametric sketch-retrieval for a performance-based generative workflow. The system would recognize the corresponding element and define variable constraints to prepare for a multi-objective optimization problem. We illustrate the the use case of our proposed system by running a real-time structural optimization form-finding study. Our findings indicate the system can be utilized as a promising generative design tool for novice users."

In this paper, we propose MangaGAN, the first method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for unpaired photo-to-manga translation. Inspired by how experienced manga artists draw manga, MangaGAN generates the geometric features of manga face by a designed GAN model and delicately translates each facial region into the manga domain by a tailored multi-GANs architecture. For training MangaGAN, we construct a new dataset collected from a popular manga work, containing manga facial features, landmarks, bodies, and so on. Moreover, to produce high-quality manga faces, we further propose a structural smoothing loss to smooth stroke-lines and avoid noisy pixels, and a similarity preserving module to improve the similarity between domains of photo and manga. Extensive experiments show that MangaGAN can produce high-quality manga faces which preserve both the facial similarity and a popular manga style, and outperforms other related state-of-the-art methods."

However, a fundamental challenge in SBIR has been largely ignored so far, that is, sketches are drawn by humans and considerable style variations exist amongst different users. An effective SBIR model needs to explicitly account for this style diversity, crucially, to generalise to unseen user styles. To this end, a novel style-agnostic SBIR model is proposed. Different from existing models, a cross-modal variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explicitly disentangle each sketch into a semantic content part shared with the corresponding photo, and a style part unique to the sketcher. Importantly, to make our model dynamically adaptable to any unseen user styles, we propose to metatrain our cross-modal VAE by adding two style-adaptive components: a set of feature transformation layers to its encoder and a regulariser to the disentangled semantic content latent code. With this meta-learning framework, our model can not only disentangle the cross-modal shared semantic content for SBIR, but can adapt the disentanglement to any unseen user style as well, making the SBIR model truly style-agnostic. Extensive experiments show that our style-agnostic model yields state-of-the-art performance for both category-level and instance-level SBIR."

However, supervision-free pre-text tasks are challenging to design and usually modality specific. Although there is a rich literature of selfsupervised methods for either spatial (such as images) or temporal data (sound or text) modalities, a common pretext task that benefits both modalities is largely missing. In this paper, we are interested in defining a self-supervised pre-text task for sketches and handwriting data. This data is uniquely characterised by its existence in dual modalities of rasterized images and vector coordinate sequences. We address and exploit this dual representation by proposing two novel cross-modal translation pre-text tasks for selfsupervised feature learning: Vectorization and Rasterization. Vectorization learns to map image space to vector coordinates and rasterization maps vector coordinates to image space. We show that our learned encoder modules benefit both raster-based and vector-based downstream approaches to analysing hand-drawn data. Empirical evidence shows that our novel pre-text tasks surpass existing single and multi-modal self-supervision methods."
"Michael P. Sheehan, J. Tachella, M. Davies",f820b189b7444957ecb74b64243c37bdf8c8af17,A Sketching Framework for Reduced Data Transfer in Photon Counting Lidar,,2021,2,"Single-photon lidar has become a prominent tool for depth imaging in recent years. At the core of the technique, the depth of a target is measured by constructing a histogram of time delays between emitted light pulses and detected photon arrivals. A major data processing bottleneck arises on the device when either the number of photons per pixel is large or the resolution of the time stamp is fine, as both the space requirement and the complexity of the image reconstruction algorithms scale with these parameters. We solve this limiting bottleneck of existing lidar techniques by sampling the characteristic function of the time of flight (ToF) model to build a compressive statistic, a socalled sketch of the time delay distribution, which is sufficient to infer the spatial distance and intensity of the object. The size of the sketch scales with the degrees of freedom of the ToF model (number of objects) and not, fundamentally, with the number of photons or the time stamp resolution. Moreover, the sketch is highly amenable for on-chip online processing. We show theoretically that the loss of information for compression is controlled and the mean squared error of the inference quickly converges towards the optimal Cramér-Rao bound (i.e. no loss of information) for modest sketch sizes. The proposed compressed single-photon lidar framework is tested and evaluated on real life datasets of complex scenes where it is shown that a compression rate of up-to 1/150 is achievable in practice without sacrificing the overall resolution of the reconstructed image."

Bhunia, Pinaki Nath Chowdhury, Aneeshan Sain, Yongxin Yang, Tao Xiang, Yi-Zhe Song",ee3ec7893003ba55175a183b13baad845e5375e1,More Photos are All You Need: Semi-Supervised Learning for Fine-Grained Sketch Based Image Retrieval,ArXiv,2021,2,"A fundamental challenge faced by existing Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (FG-SBIR) models is the data scarcity – model performances are largely bottlenecked by the lack of sketch-photo pairs. Whilst the number of photos can be easily scaled, each corresponding sketch still needs to be individually produced. In this paper, we aim to mitigate such an upper-bound on sketch data, and study whether unlabelled photos alone (of which they are many) can be cultivated for performance gain. In particular, we introduce a novel semi-supervised framework for cross-modal retrieval that can additionally leverage large-scale unlabelled photos to account for data scarcity. At the center of our semi-supervision design is a sequential photo-to-sketch generation model that aims to generate paired sketches for unlabelled photos. Importantly, we further introduce a discriminator-guided mechanism to guide against unfaithful generation, together with a distillation loss-based regularizer to provide tolerance against noisy training samples. Last but not least, we treat generation and retrieval as two conjugate problems, where a joint learning procedure is devised for each module to mutually benefit from each other. Extensive experiments show that our semi-supervised model yields a significant performance boost over the state-of-theart supervised alternatives, as well as existing methods that can exploit unlabelled photos for FG-SBIR."

Unlike previous methods that either requires the sketch-image pairs or utilize low-quantity detected edges as sketches, we study the exemplar-based sketch-to-image (s2i) synthesis task in a self-supervised learning manner, eliminating the necessity of the paired sketch data. To this end, we first propose an unsupervised method to efficiently synthesize line-sketches for general RGB-only datasets. With the synthetic paired-data, we then present a self-supervised Auto-Encoder (AE) to decouple the content/style features from sketches and RGB-images, and synthesize images that are both content-faithful to the sketches and style-consistent to the RGB-images. While prior works employ either the cycle-consistence loss or dedicated attentional modules to enforce the content/style fidelity, we show AE's superior performance with pure self-supervisions. To further improve the synthesis quality in high resolution, we also leverage an adversarial network to refine the details of synthetic images. Extensive experiments on 1024*1024 resolution demonstrate a new state-of-art-art performance of the proposed model on CelebA-HQ and Wiki-Art datasets. Moreover, with the proposed sketch generator, the model shows a promising performance on style mixing and style transfer, which require synthesized images to be both style-consistent and semantically meaningful.

In this work, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval problem of fine-grained instance-level sketch-based video retrieval (FG-SBVR), where a sketch sequence is used as a query to retrieve a specific target video instance. Compared with sketch-based still image retrieval, and coarse-grained category-level video retrieval, this is more challenging as both visual appearance and motion need to be simultaneously matched at a fine-grained level. We contribute the first FG-SBVR dataset with rich annotations. We then introduce a novel multi-stream multi-modality deep network to perform FG-SBVR under both strong and weakly supervised settings. The key component of the network is a relation module, designed to prevent model overfitting given scarce training data. We show that this model significantly outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art models designed for video analysis."

This problem is challenging since the visual features of corresponding points at different views can be very different. To this end, we take a deep learning approach and learn a novel local sketch descriptor from data. We contribute a training dataset by generating the pixel-level correspondence for the multi-view line drawings synthesized from 3D shapes. To handle the sparsity and ambiguity of sketches, we design a novel multi-branch neural network that integrates a patch-based representation and a multi-scale strategy to learn the pixel-level correspondence among multi-view sketches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with extensive experiments on hand-drawn sketches and multi-view line drawings rendered from multiple 3D shape datasets."

Forum,2021,2,"Finding point‐wise correspondences between images is a long‐standing problem in image analysis. This becomes particularly challenging for sketch images, due to the varying nature of human drawing style, projection distortions and viewport changes. In this paper, we present the first attempt to obtain a learned descriptor for dense registration in line drawings. Based on recent deep learning techniques for corresponding photographs, we designed descriptors to locally match image pairs where the object of interest belongs to the same semantic category, yet still differ drastically in shape, form, and projection angle. To this end, we have specifically crafted a data set of synthetic sketches using non‐photorealistic rendering over a large collection of part‐based registered 3D models. After training, a neural network generates descriptors for every pixel in an input image, which are shown togeneralize correctly in unseen sketches hand‐drawn by humans. We evaluate our method against a baseline of correspondences data collected from expert designers, in addition to comparisons with other descriptors that have been proven effective in sketches. Code, data and further resources will be publicly released by the time of publication."

Non-verbal signals impact the meaning of the spoken utterance in an abundance of ways. An absence of non-verbal signals impoverishes the process of communication. Yet, when users are represented as avatars, it is difficult to translate non-verbal signals along with the speech into the virtual world without specialized motion-capture hardware. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven technique for generating gestures directly from speech. Our approach is based on the application of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to model the correlation rather than causation between speech and gestures. This approach approximates neuroscience findings on how non-verbal communication and speech are correlated. We create a large dataset which consists of speech and corresponding gestures in a 3D human pose format from which our model learns the speaker-specific correlation. We evaluate the proposed technique in a user study that is inspired by the Turing test. For the study, we animate the generated gestures on a virtual character. We find that users are not able to distinguish between the generated and the recorded gestures. Moreover, users are able to identify our synthesized gestures as related or not related to a given utterance."

Due to the difference of modality between face photo and face sketch, traditional exemplar-based methods often lead to missed texture details and deformation while synthesizing sketches. And limited to the local receptive field, Convolutional Neural Networks-based methods cannot deal with the interdependence between features well, which makes the constraint of facial features insufficient; as such, it cannot retain some details in the synthetic image. Moreover, the deeper the network layer is, the more obvious the problems of gradient disappearance and explosion will be, which will lead to instability in the training process. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-scale gradients self-attention residual learning framework for face photo-sketch transformation that embeds a self-attention mechanism in the residual block, making full use of the relationship between features to selectively enhance the characteristics of specific information through self-attention distribution. Simultaneously, residual learning can keep the characteristics of the original features from being destroyed. In addition, the problem of instability in GAN training is alleviated by allowing discriminator to become a function of multi-scale outputs of the generator in the training process. Based on cycle framework, the matching between the target domain image and the source domain image can be constrained while the mapping relationship between the two domains is established so that the tasks of face photo-to-sketch synthesis (FP2S) and face sketch-to-photo synthesis (FS2P) can be achieved simultaneously. Both Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and experiments related to face recognition show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the public benchmarks, whether using FP2S or FS2P."

Both models generate curve primitives without the need for a sketch constraint solver and explicitly consider topology for downstream use with constraints and 3D CAD modeling operations. We find in our perceptual evaluation using human subjects that both CurveGen and TurtleGen produce more realistic engineering sketches when compared with the current state-of-the-art for engineering sketch generation."

Specifically, a new generator architecture is proposed to simultaneously transfer color/texture styles and transform local facial shapes into anime-like counterparts based on the style of a reference anime-face, while preserving the global structure of the source photoface.

Offline, given a trained model and its training data, SCOD employs tools from matrix sketching to tractably compute a low-rank approximation of the Fisher information matrix, which characterizes which directions in the weight space are most influential on the predictions over the training data. Online, we estimate uncertainty by measuring how much perturbations orthogonal to these directions can alter predictions at a new test input. We apply SCOD to pre-trained networks of varying architectures on several tasks, ranging from regression to classification. We demonstrate that SCOD achieves comparable or better OoD detection performance with lower computational burden relative to existing baselines."

ZS-SBIR inherits the main challenges of multiple computer vision problems including contentbased Image Retrieval (CBIR), zero-shot learning and domain adaptation. The majority of previous studies using deep neural networks have achieved improved results through either projecting sketch and images into a common low-dimensional space or transferring knowledge from seen to unseen classes. However, those approaches are trained with complex frameworks composed of multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and are dependent on category-level word labels. This increases the requirements on training resources and datasets. In comparison, we propose a simple and efficient framework that does not require high computational training resources, and can be trained on datasets without semantic categorical labels. Furthermore, at training and inference stages our method only uses a single CNN. In this work, a pre-trained ImageNet CNN (i.e.ResNet50) is fine-tuned with three proposed learning objects: domain-aware quadruplet loss, semantic classification loss, and semantic knowledge preservation loss. The domain-aware quadruplet and semantic classification losses are introduced to learn discriminative, semantic and domain invariant features through considering ZS-SBIR as a object detection and verification problem. To preserve semantic knowledge learned with ImageNet and utilise it on unseen categories, the semantic knowledge preservation loss is proposed. To reduce computational cost and increase the accuracy of the semantic knowledge distillation process, ground-truth semantic knowledge is prepared in a class-oriented fashion prior to training. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging ZS-SBIR datasets, Sketchy Extended, TU-Berlin Extended and QuickDraw Extended. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, and outperforms the majority of related works by a large margin."

The delicate depiction of sketch portraits facilitates a wide range of applications like digital entertainment and law enforcement. However, accurate and realistic face sketch generation is still a challenging task due to the illumination variations and complex backgrounds in the real scenes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Semantic-Driven Generative Adversarial Network (SDGAN) which embeds global structure-level style injection and local class-level knowledge re-weighting. Specifically, we conduct facial saliency detection on the input face photos to provide overall facial texture structure, which could be used as a global type of prior information. In addition, we exploit face parsing layouts as the semantic-level spatial prior to enforce globally structural style injection in the generator of SDGAN. Furthermore, to enhance the realistic effect of the details, we propose a novel Adaptive Re-weighting Loss (ARLoss) which dedicates to balance the contributions of different semantic classes. Experimentally, our extensive experiments on CUFS and CUFSF datasets show that our proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance."

To clearly present the underlying relations between statistical charts, animation authors need to have a high level of expertise and a considerable amount of time to describe the relations with reasonable animation stages. We present AniVis, an automated approach for generating animated transitions to demonstrate the changes between two statistical charts. AniVis models each statistical chart on the basis of a tree-based structure. Given an input chart pair, the differences of data and visual properties of the chart pair are formalized as atomic transition units. Through this approach, the animated transition between two charts is expressed as a series of transition units. Then, we conduct a preliminary study to understand people’s preferences for animation sequences. Based on the study, we propose a set of principles and a sequence composition algorithm to compose the transition units into a meaningful animation sequence. Finally, we synthesize these units together to deliver a smooth and intuitive animated transition between charts. To evaluate our workflow, we implement a web-based system and demonstrate its generated results to illustrate the usage of our approach. We perform a comparative study with the latest method to assess the animated transitions automatically generated by our system.

In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Graph Neural Network based deep learning framework, DeepGD, which can draw arbitrary graphs once trained. It attempts to generate layouts by compromising among multiple pre-specified aesthetics considering a good graph layout usually complies with multiple aesthetics simultaneously. In order to balance the trade-off, we propose two adaptive training strategies which adjust the weight factor of each aesthetic dynamically during training. The quantitative and qualitative assessment of DeepGD demonstrates that it is capable of drawing arbitrary graphs effectively, while being flexible at accommodating different aesthetic criteria."

The typical starting point in these designs is 2D sketches which can later be extruded and combined to obtain complex three-dimensional assemblies. Such sketches are typically composed of parametric primitives, such as points, lines, and circular arcs, augmented with geometric constraints linking the primitives, such as coincidence, parallelism, or orthogonality. Sketches can be represented as graphs, with the primitives as nodes and the constraints as edges. Training a model to automatically generate CAD sketches can enable several novel workflows, but is challenging due to the complexity of the graphs and the heterogeneity of the primitives and constraints. In particular, each type of primitive and constraint may require a record of different size and parameter types. We propose SketchGen as a generative model based on a transformer architecture to address the heterogeneity problem by carefully designing a sequential language for the primitives and constraints that allows distinguishing between different primitive or constraint types and their parameters, while encouraging our model to re-use information across related parameters, encoding shared structure. A particular highlight of our work is the ability to produce primitives linked via constraints that enables the final output to be further regularized via a constraint solver. We evaluate our model by demonstrating constraint prediction for given sets of primitives and full sketch generation from scratch, showing that our approach significantly out performs the state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation."

One of the major challenges is the ability of the system to generalize on faces outside the training dataset. We propose to tackle this extreme inpainting task with a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that utilizes structural information, such as edges, as a prior condition. Edge information can be obtained from the partially masked image and a structurally similar image or a hand drawing. In our proposed conditional GAN, we pass the conditional input in every layer of the encoder while maintaining consistency in the distributions between the learned weights and the incoming conditional input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with badly damaged face examples. Introduction Image inpainting is a popular and challenging problem in computer vision with applications in image editing and restoring of damaged image regions [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The damaged image regions may range from rectangular patches of various sizes to irregular regions or entire objects. In image editing, some regions are tactically damaged so that they can be inpainted with different content. In this paper we deal with the problem of extreme inpainting, where large regions of faces have been damaged with the application of an irregular mask. Initial works dealt with small square patches, while more recent approaches take on the more challenging problem of inpainting large irregular regions [3], [4]. Our face inpainting method, called FIpoly-GAN, is based on the Poly-GAN conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture [7], that was initially proposed for fashion synthesis and is suitable for various tasks, e.g. geometric transformations, image stitching and inpainting. To recover the facial structure that is lost after significant image regions have been masked, we utilize an edge sketch as a condition that guides the inpainting process by providing structure in the damaged regions. The proposed FIpoly-GAN has shown ability to generalize on faces obtained in the wild from various sources unrelated to the training data. A representative result is shown in in Fig. 1. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: • We propose FIpoly-GAN, a conditional GAN architecture that leverages edge information for extreme face inpainting. • Our FIpoly-GAN architecture uses the edge map, from a sketch or a similar image, as a condition that is fed at various levels of the network to learn the structure of the image for inpainting color and texture in the missing region. • FIpoly-GAN achieves state of the art results on standard face datasets and outperforms other methods on images that are unrelated to the training dataset. Figure 1. Example of sketch-conditioned face inpainting with the proposed FIpoly-GAN network. From left to right: original, damaged image with large irregular mask, hand-drawn sketch, inpainted result. Related Work Early inpainting methods operated under the assumption that the damaged region is a standard shape, i.e. square or rectangle. Free form inpainting, where the damaged regions are large and irregular, poses a challenge to many methods due to lack of relevant information that can be used from nearby regions. A popular approach is the Patch-based image inpainting network [1], which progressively learns to associate nearby image contect to the missing region. However, this approach is not as effective in the case of free form inpainting. Image Inpainting using Partial Convolution [2] is one of the first methods to tackle free form inpainting on images with irregular damage. It utilizes a neural network with a partial convolution layer and performs an automatic update on the binary mask. Given a binary mask, the partial convolution utilizes nondamaged information near damaged region to estimate missing content. The next step in the method is to update the binary mask according to the output of the partial convolution, so that if the output is positive for the damaged region then the mask is updated accordingly. Free-form image inpainting with Gated Convolution (SNpatchGAN) [3] is a state-of-the-art method for inpainting images with irregular damage. This method introduces a new convolution layer named gated convolution. The input features in the model are first used to compute the gating value, g = sigmoid(Wg ∗ x), where x denotes the input features. The final output of the layer is multiplication of learned features and gating values, y = φ(W ∗ x) g. The architecture includes a contextual attention module with the refinement network, with both having a gated convolution layer. Gated Convolution has inspired several other methods for image inpainting. Image inpainting via Generative Multi-column Convolutional Neural Networks (GMCNN) [4] The GMCNN network consists of three sub-networks, one generator, one global and one local discriminator for adversarial training. Only the generator is deployed when testing on a new image. SC-FEGAN [5] and Face-Shop [6] are state-of-the-art image inpainting methods based on image editing. They work by providing the network a simple sketch of the face. Both methods use a similar approach to generate sketch images of the face, which can be edited and passed to the model as conditional input.

In the preprocessing phase of our algorithm, we compute this representation of A in O(n3 log n) operations.

However, each modality embeddings stem from nonrelated feature spaces, which causes the notorious ’heterogeneity gap’. Currently, many cross-modal systems try to bridge the gap with self-attention. However, self-attention has been widely criticized for its quadratic complexity, which prevents many real-life applications. In response to this, we propose T-EMDE a neural density estimator inspired by the recently introduced Efficient Manifold Density Estimator (EMDE) from the area of recommender systems. EMDE operates on sketches representations especially suitable for multimodal operations. However, EMDE is non-differentiable and ingests precomputed, static embeddings. With T-EMDE we introduce a trainable version of EMDE which allows full end-to-end training. In contrast to self-attention, the complexity of our solution is linear to the number of tokens/segments. As such, T-EMDE is a drop-in replacement for the self-attention module, with beneficial influence on both speed and metric performance in cross-modal settings. It facilitates communication between modalities, as each global text/image representation is expressed with a standardized sketch histogram which represents the same manifold structures irrespective of the underlying modality. We evaluate T-EMDE by introducing it into two recent cross-modal SOTAmodels and achieving new state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets and decreasing model latency by up to 20%."

Specifically, we exploit transfer learning for deep features extraction from images. Firstly, we adopt InceptionV3 pretrained on ImageNet as features extractor, secondly, we try out several CNNs built on top of InceptionV3 as convolutional base fine-tuned on our dataset. In both of the previous cases we index the features extracted within our LSH index implementation so as to compare the retrieval performances with and without fine-tuning. In our approach we try out two different LSH implementations: the first one working with real number feature vectors and the second one with the binary transposed version of those vectors. Interestingly, we obtain the best performances when using the binary LSH, reaching almost the same result, in terms of mean average precision, obtained by performing sequential scan of the features, thus avoiding the bias introduced by the LSH index. Lastly, we carry out a performance analysis class by class in terms of recall against mAP highlighting, as expected, a strong positive correlation between the two."

Therefore in this work, we present different results of evaluating methods for producing compact embeddings in the context of sketch-based image retrieval. Our main interest is in strategies aiming to keep the local structure of the original space. The recent unsupervised local-topology preserving dimension reduction method UMAP fits our requirements and shows outstanding performance, improving even the precision achieved by SOTA methods.

In a sketching phase, the data is first compressed to a lightweight sketch vector, obtained by mapping the data samples through a well-chosen feature map, and averaging those contributions. In a learning phase, the desired model parameters are then extracted from this sketch by solving an optimization problem, which also involves a feature map. When the feature map is identical during the sketching and learning phases, formal statistical guarantees (excess risk bounds) have been proven. However, the desirable properties of the feature map are different during sketching and learning (e.g., quantized outputs, and differentiability, respectively). We thus study the relaxation where this map is allowed to be different for each phase. First, we prove that the existing guarantees carry over to this asymmetric scheme, up to a controlled error term, provided some Limited Projected Distortion (LPD) property holds. We then instantiate this framework to the setting of quantized sketches, by proving that the LPD indeed holds for binary sketch contributions. Finally, we further validate the approach with numerical simulations, including a large-scale application in audio event classification."

Structural regularization (SR) refers to a family of algorithms that mitigate catastrophic forgetting by penalizing the network for changing its “critical parameters” from previous tasks while learning a new one. The penalty is often induced via a quadratic regularizer defined by an importance matrix, e.g., the (empirical) Fisher information matrix in the Elastic Weight Consolidation framework. In practice and due to computational constraints, most SR methods crudely approximate the importance matrix by its diagonal. In this paper, we propose Sketched Structural Regularization (Sketched SR) as an alternative approach to compress the importance matrices used for regularizing in SR methods. Specifically, we apply linear sketching methods to better approximate the importance matrices in SR algorithms. We show that sketched SR: (i) is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement, (ii) provides an approximation error that is justified in theory, and (iii) is method oblivious by construction and can be adapted to any method that belongs to the structural regularization class. We show that our proposed approach consistently improves various SR algorithms’ performance on both synthetic experiments and benchmark continual learning tasks, including permuted-MNIST and CIFAR-100."

While current work have applied RL effectively to portray physics-based skills, social behaviours are challenging to design reward functions for, due to their lack of physical interaction with the world. On the other hand, data-driven implementations for these skills have been limited to supervised learning methods which require extensive training data and carry constraints on generalisability. In this paper, we propose RLAnimate, a novel data-driven deep RL approach to address this challenge, where we combine the strengths of RL together with an ability to learn from a motion dataset when creating agents. We formalise a mathematical structure for training agents by refining the conceptual roles of elements such as agents, environments, states and actions, in a way that leverages attributes of the character animation domain and model-based RL. An agent trained using our approach learns versatile animation dynamics to portray multiple behaviours, using an iterative RL training process, which becomes aware of valid behaviours via representations learnt from motion capture clips. We demonstrate, by training agents that portray realistic pointing and waving behaviours, that our approach requires a significantly lower training time, and substantially fewer sample episodes to be generated during training relative to state-of-the-art physics-based RL methods. Also, compared to existing supervised learning-based animation agents, RLAnimate needs a limited dataset of motion clips to generate representations of valid behaviours during training."

It is challenging due to the lack of training supervision and the large geometry distortion between the freehand sketch and photo domains. To synthesize the absent freehand sketches from photos, we propose a framework that jointly learns sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation. However, the generator trained from fake sketches might lead to unsatisfying results when dealing with sketches of missing classes, due to the domain gap between synthesized sketches and real ones. To alleviate this issue, we further propose a simple yet effective open-domain sampling and optimization strategy to “fool” the generator into treating fake sketches as real ones. Our method takes advantage of the learned sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch mapping of in-domain data and generalizes them to the open-domain classes. We validate our method on the Scribble and SketchyCOCO datasets. Compared with the recent competing methods, our approach shows impressive results in synthesizing realistic color, texture, and maintaining the geometric composition for various categories of open-domain sketches."

We split the approach into three parts. Firstly, we focus on finding a more suitable NMT baseline for this problem. Secondly, we show that the performance of the NMT models can be improved by training on examples containing a specific file type. Lastly, we introduce a novel sketch-based neural model inspired by recent approaches used for code generation and we show that the sketch-based encoder significantly outperforms existing state of the art solutions.

Therefore, it is desirable to develop computational models that can automatically interpolate the in-between animation frames. However, existing video interpolation methods fail to produce satisfying results on animation data. Compared to natural videos, animation videos possess two unique characteristics that make frame interpolation difficult: 1) cartoons comprise lines and smooth color pieces. The smooth areas lack textures and make it difficult to estimate accurate motions on animation videos. 2) cartoons express stories via exaggeration. Some of the motions are non-linear and extremely large. In this work, we formally define and study the animation video interpolation problem for the first time. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an effective framework, AnimeInterp, with two dedicated modules in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, 1) Segment-Guided Matching resolves the “lack of textures” challenge by exploiting global matching among color pieces that are piecewise coherent. 2) Recurrent Flow Refinement resolves the “non-linear and extremely large motion” challenge by recurrent predictions using a transformer-like architecture.

Counterfactual story rewriting is a recently proposed task to test the causal reasoning ability for text generation models, which requires a model to predict the corresponding story ending when the condition is modified to a counterfactual one. Previous works have shown that the traditional sequence-tosequence model cannot well handle this problem, as it often captures some spurious correlations between the original and counterfactual endings, instead of the causal relations between conditions and endings. To address this issue, we propose a sketch-and-customize generation model guided by the causality implicated in the conditions and endings. In the sketch stage, a skeleton is extracted by removing words which are conflict to the counterfactual condition, from the original ending. In the customize stage, a generation model is used to fill proper words in the skeleton under the guidance of the counterfactual condition. In this way, the obtained counterfactual ending is both relevant to the original ending and consistent with the counterfactual condition. Experimental results show that the proposed model generates much better endings, as compared with the traditional sequence-to-sequence model."

To this end, this paper proposes learning a Sketch Tensor (ST) space for inpainting man-made scenes.

Our output is a 3D pose sequence depicting the actions in the input sentence. We propose a hierarchical two-stream sequential model to explore a finer jointlevel mapping between natural language sentences and 3D pose sequences corresponding to the given motion. We learn two manifold representations of the motion – one each for the upper body and the lower body movements. Our model can generate plausible pose sequences for short sentences describing single actions as well as long compositional sentences describing multiple sequential and superimposed actions. We evaluate our proposed model on the publicly available KIT Motion-Language Dataset containing 3D pose data with human-annotated sentences.

One could instead hope to learn a distribution on sketching matrices that is optimized for the specific distribution of input matrices. We show how to design learned sketches for the Hessian in the context of second order methods, where we learn potentially different sketches for the different iterations of an optimization procedure. We show empirically that learned sketches, compared with their “non-learned” counterparts, improve the approximation accuracy for important problems, including LASSO, SVM, and matrix estimation with nuclear norm constraints. Several of our schemes can be proven to perform no worse than their unlearned counterparts. Additionally, we show that a smaller sketching dimension of the column space of a tall matrix is possible, assuming an oracle for predicting rows which have a large leverage score."

This paper proposes the pointless motive to classify the gender of celebrities' portraits as an excuse for exploration in a broad, more artistic sense. Investigation results drove compelling ideas here discussed. The experiments compared different ways to represent draws to be input in a network and showed that an absolute format of coordinates (x, y) was a better performer than a relative one (Dx, Dy) with respect to prior points, most frequent in the reviewed literature. Experiments also showed that, due to the recurrent nature of LSTMs, the order of lines forming a drawing is a relevant factor for input in an LSTM classifier not studied before. A minimum 'pencil' traveled length criteria for line ordering proved suitable, possible by reducing it to a TSP particular instance. The best configuration for gender classification appears with an LSTM layer that returns the hidden state value for each input point step, followed by a global average layer along the sequence, before the output dense layer. That result guided the idea of removing the average in the network pipeline and return a per-point attribute score just by adjusting tensors dimensions. With this trick, the model detects an attribute in a drawing and also recognizes the points linked to it. Moreover, by overlapping filtered lines of portraits, an attribute's visual essence is depicted. Meet the FaCells."

In this paper, we focus on the learning-augmented CMS of Cai, Mitzenmacher and Adams (NeurIPS 2018), which relies on Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) modeling of a data stream via Dirichlet process (DP) priors. This is referred to as the CMS-DP, and it leads to BNP estimates of a point query as posterior means of the point query given the hashed data. While BNPs is proved to be a powerful tool for developing robust learning-augmented CMSs, ideas and methods behind the CMS-DP are tailored to point queries under DP priors, and they can not be used for other priors or more general queries. In this paper, we present an alternative, and more flexible, derivation of the CMS-DP such that: i) it allows to make use of the Pitman-Yor process (PYP) prior, which is arguably the most popular generalization of the DP prior; ii) it can be readily applied to the more general problem of estimating range queries. This leads to develop a novel learning-augmented CMS under powerlaw data streams, referred to as the CMS-PYP, which relies on BNP modeling of the stream via PYP priors.

However, sketch extraction suffers from serious disease corrosion, which results in broken lines and noise. To overcome these problems, we propose a deep learning-based hierarchical sketch extraction framework for painted cultural relics. We design the sketch extraction process into two stages: coarse extraction and fine extraction. In the coarse extraction stage, we develop a novel detail-aware bi-directional cascade network that integrates flow-based difference-of-Gaussians (FDoG) edge detection and a bi-directional cascade network (BDCN) under a transfer learning framework. It not only uses the pre-trained strategy to extenuate the requirements of large datasets for deep network training but also guides the network to learn the detail characteristics by the prior knowledge from FDoG. For the fine extraction stage, we design a new multiscale U-Net (MSU-Net) to effectively remove disease noise and refine the sketch. Specifically, all the features extracted from multiple intermediate layers in the decoder of MSU-Net are fused for sketch predication. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperforms the other seven state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual and quantitative metrics and can also deal with complex backgrounds."

Representative skills that exhibit such ability include generating image descriptions and visually grounded referring expressions. In the NLG community, these generation tasks are largely investigated in non-interactive and language-only settings. However, in face-to-face interaction, humans often deploy multiple modalities to communicate, forming seamless integration of natural language, hand gestures and other modalities like sketches. To enable robots to describe what they perceive with speech and sketches/gestures, we propose to model the task of generating natural language together with free-hand sketches/hand gestures to describe visual scenes and reallife objects, namely, visually-grounded multimodal description generation. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and evaluation metrics of the task, and how the task can benefit from progress recently made in the natural language processing and computer vision realms, where related topics such as visually grounded NLG, distributional semantics, and photo-based sketch generation have been extensively studied."

Manga translation involves two important problems in MT: context-aware and multimodal translation. Since text and images are mixed up in an unstructured fashion in manga, obtaining context from the image is essential for its translation. However, it is still an open problem how to extract context from images and integrate into MT models. In addition, corpus and benchmarks to train and evaluate such models are currently unavailable. In this paper, we make the following four contributions that establish the foundation of manga translation research. First, we propose a multimodal context-aware translation framework. We are the first to incorporate context information obtained from manga images. It enables us to translate texts in speech bubbles that cannot be translated without using context information (e.g., texts in other speech bubbles, gender of speakers, etc.). Second, for training the model, we propose the approach to automatic corpus construction from pairs of original manga and their translations, by which a large parallel corpus can be constructed without any manual labeling. Third, we created a new benchmark to evaluate manga translation. Finally, on top of our proposed methods, we devised a first comprehensive system for fully automated manga translation."

Existing pencil sketch algorithms are based on texture rendering rather than the direct imitation of strokes, making them unable to show the drawing process but only a final result. To address this challenge, we first establish a pencil stroke imitation mechanism. Next, we develop a framework with three branches to guide stroke drawing: the first branch guides the direction of the strokes, the second branch determines the shade of the strokes, and the third branch enhances the details further. Under this framework's guidance, we can produce a pencil sketch by drawing one stroke every time. Our method is fully interpretable. Comparison with existing pencil drawing algorithms shows that our method is superior to others in terms of texture quality, style, and user evaluation."

Considering the intuitive artifacts in the existing methods, we propose a contrastive style loss for style rendering to enforce the similarity between the style of rendered photo and the caricature, and simultaneously enhance its discrepancy to the photos. To obtain an exaggerating deformation in an unpaired/unsupervised fashion, we propose a Distortion Prediction Module (DPM) to predict a set of displacements vectors for each input image while fixing some controlling points, followed by the thin plate spline interpolation for warping. The model is trained on unpaired photo and caricature while can offer bidirectional synthesizing via inputting either a photo or a caricature. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is effective to generate hand-drawn like caricatures compared with existing competitors."

However, the identification of these winning tickets still requires the costly train-prune-retrain process, limiting their practical benefits. In this paper, we discover for the first time that the winning tickets can be identified at the very early training stage, which we term as early-bird (EB) tickets, via low-cost training schemes (e.g., early stopping and low-precision training) at large learning rates. Our finding of EB tickets is consistent with recently reported observations that the key connectivity patterns of neural networks emerge early. Furthermore, we propose a mask distance metric that can be used to identify EB tickets with low computational overhead, without needing to know the true winning tickets that emerge after the full training. Finally, we leverage the existence of EB tickets and the proposed mask distance to develop efficient training methods, which are achieved by first identifying EB tickets via low-cost schemes, and then continuing to train merely the EB tickets towards the target accuracy. Experiments based on various deep networks and datasets validate: 1) the existence of EB tickets, and the effectiveness of mask distance in efficiently identifying them; and 2) that the proposed efficient training via EB tickets can achieve up to 4.7x energy savings while maintaining comparable or even better accuracy, demonstrating a promising and easily adopted method for tackling cost-prohibitive deep network training."

It covers wide applications including digital entertainment and law enforcement. Precisely depicting face photos/sketches remains challenging due to the restrictions on structural realism and textural consistency. While existing methods achieve compelling results, they mostly yield blurred effects and great deformation over various facial components, leading to the unrealistic feeling of synthesized images. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we propose using facial composition information to help the synthesis of face sketch/photo. Especially, we propose a novel composition-aided generative adversarial network (CA-GAN) for face photo-sketch synthesis. In CA-GAN, we utilize paired inputs, including a face photo/sketch and the corresponding pixelwise face labels for generating a sketch/photo. Next, to focus training on hard-generated components and delicate facial structures, we propose a compositional reconstruction loss. In addition, we employ a perceptual loss function to encourage the synthesized image and real image to be perceptually similar. Finally, we use stacked CA-GANs (SCA-GANs) to further rectify defects and add compelling details. The experimental results show that our method is capable of generating both visually comfortable and identity-preserving face sketches/photos over a wide range of challenging data. In addition, our method significantly decreases the best previous Fréchet inception distance (FID) from 36.2 to 26.2 for sketch synthesis, and from 60.9 to 30.5 for photo synthesis.

In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm, called FetchSGD, to overcome these challenges. FetchSGD compresses model updates using a Count Sketch, and then takes advantage of the mergeability of sketches to combine model updates from many workers. A key insight in the design of FetchSGD is that, because the Count Sketch is linear, momentum and error accumulation can both be carried out within the sketch. This allows the algorithm to move momentum and error accumulation from clients to the central aggregator, overcoming the challenges of sparse client participation while still achieving high compression rates and good convergence. We prove that FetchSGD has favorable convergence guarantees, and we demonstrate its empirical effectiveness by training two residual networks and a transformer model."

However, most existing deep-learning-based face sketch synthesis models stacked only by multiple convolutional layers without structured regression often lose the common facial structures, limiting their flexibility in a wide range of practical applications, including intelligent security and digital entertainment. In this article, we introduce a neural network to a probabilistic graphical model and propose a novel face sketch synthesis framework based on the neural probabilistic graphical model (NPGM) composed of a specific structure and a common structure. In the specific structure, we investigate a neural network for mapping the direct relationship between training photos and sketches, yielding the specific information and characteristic features of a test photo. In the common structure, the fidelity between the sketch pixels generated by the specific structure and their candidates selected from the training data are considered, ensuring the preservation of the common facial structure. Experimental results on the Chinese University of Hong Kong face sketch database demonstrate, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that the proposed NPGM-based face sketch synthesis approach can more effectively capture specific features and recover common structures compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments in practical applications further illustrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance."

Colorizing a sketch image is in high demand in comics, animation, and other content creation applications, but it suffers from information scarcity of a sketch image. To address this, a reference image can render the colorization process in a reliable and user-driven manner. However, it is difficult to prepare for a training data set that has a sufficient amount of semantically meaningful pairs of images as well as the ground truth for a colored image reflecting a given reference (e.g., coloring a sketch of an originally blue car given a reference green car). To tackle this challenge, we propose to utilize the identical image with geometric distortion as a virtual reference, which makes it possible to secure the ground truth for a colored output image. Furthermore, it naturally provides the ground truth for dense semantic correspondence, which we utilize in our internal attention mechanism for color transfer from reference to sketch input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various types of sketch image colorization via quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation against existing methods."

The primary goal is to generate a plausible caricature with reasonable exaggerations given a face image. Conventional caricature generation approaches mainly use low-level geometric transformations such as image warping to generate exaggerated images, which lack richness and diversity in terms of content and style. The recent progress in generative adversarial networks (GANs) makes it possible to learn an image-to-image transformation from data so as to generate diverse images. However, directly applying GAN-based models to this task leads to unsatisfactory results due to the large variance in the caricature distribution. Moreover, conventional models typically require pixel-wisely paired training data which largely limits their usage scenarios. In this paper, we model caricature generation as a weakly paired image-to-image translation task, and propose CariGAN to address these issues. Specifically, to enforce reasonable exaggeration and facial deformation, manually annotated caricature facial landmarks are used as an additional condition to constrain the generated image. Furthermore, an image fusion mechanism is designed to encourage our model to focus on the key facial parts so that more vivid details in these regions can be generated. Finally, a diversity loss is proposed to encourage the model to produce diverse results. Extensive experiments on a large-scale ""WebCaricature"" dataset show that the proposed CariGAN can generate more visually plausible caricatures with larger diversity compared with the state-of-the-art models."

Graph.,2020,14,"Transferring the motion style from one animation clip to another, while preserving the motion content of the latter, has been a long-standing problem in character animation. Most existing data-driven approaches are supervised and rely on paired data, where motions with the same content are performed in different styles. In addition, these approaches are limited to transfer of styles that were seen during training. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework for motion style transfer, which learns from an unpaired collection of motions with style labels, and enables transferring motion styles not observed during training. Furthermore, our framework is able to extract motion styles directly from videos, bypassing 3D reconstruction, and apply them to the 3D input motion. Our style transfer network encodes motions into two latent codes, for content and for style, each of which plays a different role in the decoding (synthesis) process. While the content code is decoded into the output motion by several temporal convolutional layers, the style code modifies deep features via temporally invariant adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN). Moreover, while the content code is encoded from 3D joint rotations, we learn a common embedding for style from either 3D or 2D joint positions, enabling style extraction from videos. Our results are comparable to the state-of-the-art, despite not requiring paired training data, and outperform other methods when transferring previously unseen styles. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate style transfer directly from videos to 3D animations - an ability which enables one to extend the set of style examples far beyond motions captured by MoCap systems."

We further propose an on-the-fly design that starts retrieving as soon as the user starts drawing. To accomplish this, we devise a reinforcement learning based cross-modal retrieval framework that directly optimizes rank of the ground-truth photo over a complete sketch drawing episode.

Moreover, sketches often demonstrate huge variety among different users, demanding even higher generalizability and robustness for the editing model to work. In this paper, we propose Deep Plastic Surgery, a novel, robust and controllable image editing framework that allows users to interactively edit images using hand-drawn sketch inputs. We present a sketch refinement strategy, as inspired by the coarse-to-fine drawing process of the artists, which we show can help our model well adapt to casual and varied sketches without the need for real sketch training data. Our model further provides a refinement level control parameter that enables users to flexibly define how ""reliable"" the input sketch should be considered for the final output, balancing between sketch faithfulness and output verisimilitude (as the two goals might contradict if the input sketch is drawn poorly).

Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) based methods have significantly improved the quality of image synthesis, but they have not explicitly considered the purpose of recognition. In this paper, we first propose an Identity-Aware CycleGAN (IACycleGAN) model that applies a new perceptual loss to supervise the image generation network. It improves CycleGAN on photo-sketch synthesis by paying more attention to the synthesis of key facial regions, such as eyes and nose, which are important for identity recognition. Furthermore, we develop a mutual optimization procedure between the synthesis model and the recognition model, which iteratively synthesizes better images by IACycleGAN and enhances the recognition model by the triplet loss of the generated and real samples. Extensive experiments are performed on both photo-to-sketch and sketch-to-photo tasks using the widely used CUFS and CUFSF databases. The results show that the proposed method performs better than several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both synthetic image quality and photo-sketch recognition accuracy."

How to align abstract sketches and natural images into a common high-level semantic space remains a key problem in SBIR. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-heterogeneous three-way joint embedding network (Semi3-Net), which integrates three branches (a sketch branch, a natural image branch, and an edgemap branch) to learn more discriminative cross-domain feature representations for the SBIR task. The key insight lies with how we cultivate the mutual and subtle relationships amongst the sketches, natural images, and edgemaps. A semi-heterogeneous feature mapping is designed to extract bottom features from each domain, where the sketch and edgemap branches are shared while the natural image branch is heterogeneous to the other branches. In addition, a joint semantic embedding is introduced to embed the features from different domains into a common high-level semantic space, where all of the three branches are shared. To further capture informative features common to both natural images and the corresponding edgemaps, a co-attention model is introduced to conduct common channel-wise feature recalibration between different domains. A hybrid-loss mechanism is designed to align the three branches, where an alignment loss and a sketch-edgemap contrastive loss are presented to encourage the network to learn invariant cross-domain representations. Experimental results on two widely used category-level datasets (Sketchy and TU-Berlin Extension) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

Specifically, we are interested in the user's behavior and response to an AI partner when engaged in a design task. By developing deep learning models of the sketches from a large-scale dataset, the user can control the amount of visual and conceptual similarity of the AI response when requesting inspiration from the CSP.

The participants' behavior maps into clusters that are co-related with three types of design creativity: combinatorial, exploratory, and transformational. Our findings demonstrate that the tool can facilitate ideation and overcome design fixation.

An intelligent face sketch synthesis system requires a strong robustness to lighting variations. Under uncontrolled lighting conditions in real-world settings, such a system will perform consistently well and have little restriction on the lighting conditions. However, previous face sketch synthesis methods tend to synthesize sketches under well-controlled lighting conditions. These methods are sensitive to lighting variations and produce unsatisfactory results when the lighting condition varies. In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded face sketch synthesis framework composed of a multiple feature generator and a cascaded low-rank representation. The multiple feature generator not only produces a generated sketch feature consistent with an artist’s drawing style but also extracts a photo feature that is robust to various illuminations. Both features ensure that given a photo patch, the optimal sketch candidates can be selected from the database. The cascaded low-rank representation enables a gradual reduction in the gap between the synthesized face sketch and the corresponding artist-drawn sketch. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed cascaded framework generates realistic sketches on par with the current methods on the Chinese University of Hong Kong face sketch database under well-controlled illuminations. Moreover, this framework exhibits greatly improved performance compared to these methods on the extended Chinese University of Hong Kong face sketch database and Chinese celebrity face photos from the web under different illuminations. We argue that this framework paves a novel way for the implementation of computer-aided optical systems that are of essential importance in both face sketch synthesis and optical imaging."

In this paper, we formulate FG-SBIR as a coarse-to-fine process, and propose a Deep Cascaded Cross-modal Ranking Model (DCCRM) that can exploit all the beneficial multimodal information in sketches and annotated images and improve both the retrieval efficiency and the top-K ranked effectiveness. Our goal concentrates on constructing deep representations for sketches, images, and descriptions, and learning the optimized deep correlations across such different domains.

Existing works only deal with style change or spatial deformation alone, synthesizing photos from edge-aligned line drawings or transforming shapes within the same modality, e.g., color images. Our key insight is to decompose unsupervised sketch-to-photo synthesis into a two-stage translation task: First shape translation from sketches to grayscale photos and then content enrichment from grayscale to color photos. We also incorporate a self-supervised denoising objective and an attention module to handle abstraction and style variations that are inherent and specific to sketches.

Real-world regexes are complex, hard to describe with brief sentences, and sometimes require examples to fully convey the user’s intent. We present a framework for regex synthesis in this setting where both natural language (NL) and examples are available. First, a semantic parser (either grammar-based or neural) maps the natural language description into an intermediate sketch, which is an incomplete regex containing holes to denote missing components. Then a program synthesizer searches over the regex space defined by the sketch and finds a regex that is consistent with the given string examples. Our semantic parser can be trained purely from weak supervision based on correctness of the synthesized regex, or it can leverage heuristically derived sketches. We evaluate on two prior datasets (Kushman and Barzilay 2013; Locascio et al. 2016) and a real-world dataset from Stack Overflow.

Can we go further and adapt the gesturing style to follow a specific speaker? Gestures that are naturally timed with corresponding speech during human communication are called co-speech gestures. A key challenge, called gesture style transfer, is to learn a model that generates these gestures for a speaking agent 'A' in the gesturing style of a target speaker 'B'. A secondary goal is to simultaneously learn to generate co-speech gestures for multiple speakers while remembering what is unique about each speaker. We call this challenge style preservation. In this paper, we propose a new model, named Mix-StAGE, which trains a single model for multiple speakers while learning unique style embeddings for each speaker's gestures in an end-to-end manner. A novelty of Mix-StAGE is to learn a mixture of generative models which allows for conditioning on the unique gesture style of each speaker. As Mix-StAGE disentangles style and content of gestures, gesturing styles for the same input speech can be altered by simply switching the style embeddings. Mix-StAGE also allows for style preservation when learning simultaneously from multiple speakers. We also introduce a new dataset, Pose-Audio-Transcript-Style (PATS), designed to study gesture generation and style transfer. Our proposed Mix-StAGE model significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach for gesture generation and provides a path towards performing gesture style transfer across multiple speakers.

Due to its unique characteristics, existing methods achieve decent results only with paired training data, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain.In this paper, we address the problem of automatic transfer from face photos to portrait drawings with unpaired training data. We observe that due to the significant imbalance of information richness between photos and drawings, existing unpaired transfer methods such as CycleGAN tends to embed invisible reconstruction information indiscriminately in the whole drawings, leading to important facial features partially missing in drawings. To address this problem, we propose a novel asymmetric cycle mapping that enforces the reconstruction information to be visible (by a truncation loss) and only embedded in selective facial regions (by a relaxed forward cycle-consistency loss). Along with localized discriminators for the eyes, nose and lips, our method well preserves all important facial features in the generated portrait drawings.

Therefore, we argue that a desirable scene graph should be also hierarchically constructed, and introduce a new scheme for modeling scene graph. Concretely, a scene is represented by a human-mimetic Hierarchical Entity Tree (HET) consisting of a series of image regions. To generate a scene graph based on HET, we parse HET with a Hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (Hybrid-LSTM) which specifically encodes hierarchy and siblings context to capture the structured information embedded in HET. To further prioritize key relations in the scene graph, we devise a Relation Ranking Module (RRM) to dynamically adjust their rankings by learning to capture humans' subjective perceptive habits from objective entity saliency and size.

A Siamese network is constructed to extract deep patch representation from a raw facial patch, where the representative detail information for robust face sketch synthesis can be exploited. The generated deep patch representation and facial image patches are then optimally combined through a probabilistic graphical model.

Most existing methods solve this problem by simultaneously projecting visual features and semantic supervision into a low-dimensional common space for efficient retrieval. However, such low-dimensional projection destroys the completeness of semantic knowledge in original semantic space, so that it is unable to transfer useful knowledge well when learning semantic from different modalities. Moreover, the domain information and semantic information are entangled in visual features, which is not conducive for cross-modal matching since it will hinder the reduction of domain gap between sketch and image. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Domain-independent Feature Decomposition (PDFD) network for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, with the supervision of original semantic knowledge, PDFD decomposes visual features into domain features and semantic ones, and then the semantic features are projected into common space as retrieval features for ZS-SBIR. The progressive projection strategy maintains strong semantic supervision. Besides, to guarantee the retrieval features to capture clean and complete semantic information, the cross-reconstruction loss is introduced to encourage that any combinations of retrieval features and domain features can reconstruct the visual features.

However, the accuracy of SBRSIR algorithm, which is critical to effective retrieval, is still far behind classic query-by-example image retrieval. Two central limiting factors for this performance gap are: 1) the lack of effective cross-domain representations for bridging the domain gap between sketches and remote sensing images and 2) the absence of large sketch/remote sensing image data sets for developing, evaluating, and comparing the SBRSIR approaches.

A novel spatial attention pooling (SAP) is designed to adaptively handle stroke distortions which are spatially varying to support various stroke styles and different level of details. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing methods on both image quality and model generalization to hand-drawn sketches."

Prior successes on fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) have demonstrated the importance of tackling the unique traits of sketches as opposed to photos, e.g., temporal vs. static, strokes vs. pixels, and abstract vs. pixel-perfect. In this paper, we study a further trait of sketches that has been overlooked to date, that is, they are hierarchical in terms of the levels of detail -- a person typically sketches up to various extents of detail to depict an object. This hierarchical structure is often visually distinct. In this paper, we design a novel network that is capable of cultivating sketch-specific hierarchies and exploiting them to match sketch with photo at corresponding hierarchical levels. In particular, features from a sketch and a photo are enriched using cross-modal co-attention, coupled with hierarchical node fusion at every level to form a better embedding space to conduct retrieval. Experiments on common benchmarks show our method to outperform state-of-the-arts by a significant margin."

Fundamentally, a sketch is stored as a sequence of data points, a vector format representation, rather than the photo-realistic image of pixels. SketchRNN studied a generative neural representation for sketches of vector format by Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM). Unfortunately, the representation learned by SketchRNN is primarily for the generation tasks, rather than the other tasks of recognition and retrieval of sketches. To this end and inspired by the recent BERT model, we present a model of learning Sketch Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (Sketch-BERT). We generalize BERT to sketch domain, with the novel proposed components and pre-training algorithms, including the newly designed sketch embedding networks, and the self-supervised learning of sketch gestalt. Particularly, towards the pre-training task, we present a novel Sketch Gestalt Model (SGM) to help train the Sketch-BERT.

The proposed RoboCoDraw system takes a real human face image as input, converts it to a stylized avatar, then draws it with a robotic arm. A core component in this system is the Avatar-GAN proposed by us, which generates a cartoon avatar face image from a real human face. AvatarGAN is trained with unpaired face and avatar images only and can generate avatar images of much better likeness with human face images in comparison with the vanilla CycleGAN. After the avatar image is generated, it is fed to a line extraction algorithm and converted to sketches.

Our method is designed to learn from a traditionally animated sequence, where each frame is drawn by an artist, and thus the input images lack any common structure, correspondences, or labels. We express pose changes as a deformation of a layered 2.5D template mesh, and devise a novel architecture that learns to predict mesh deformations matching the template to a target image. This enables us to extract a common low-dimensional structure from a diverse set of character poses. We combine recent advances in differentiable rendering as well as mesh-aware models to successfully align common template even if only a few character images are available during training. In addition to coarse poses, character appearance also varies due to shading, out-of-plane motions, and artistic effects. We capture these subtle changes by applying an image translation network to refine the mesh rendering, providing an end-to-end model to generate new animations of a character with high visual quality. We demonstrate that our generative model can be used to synthesize in-between frames and to create data-driven deformation. Our template fitting procedure outperforms state-of-the-art generic techniques for detecting image correspondences."

Here, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are used to study the impact of structural anisotropy on the thermoelectric properties of disordered organic semiconductors. It is found that stretching is a suitable strategy to improve the conductivity along the direction of strain, whereas the effect on the power factor depends on the morphology the polymer crystallizes.

Most previous methods project the sketch and image features into a low-dimensional common space for efficient retrieval, and meantime align the projected features to their semantic features (e.g., category-level word vectors) in order to transfer knowledge from seen to unseen classes. However, the projection and alignment are always coupled; as a result, there is a lack of explicit alignment that consequently leads to unsatisfactory zero-shot retrieval performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel progressive cross-modal semantic network. More specifically, it first explicitly aligns the sketch and image features to semantic features, then projects the aligned features to a common space for subsequent retrieval. We further employ cross-reconstruction loss to encourage the aligned features to capture complete knowledge about the two modalities, along with multi-modal Euclidean loss that guarantees similarity between the retrieval features from a sketch-image pair. Extensive experiments conducted on two popular large-scale datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors to a remarkable extent: by more than 3% on the Sketchy dataset and about 6% on the TU-Berlin dataset in terms of retrieval accuracy."

In this paper, we propose a deep architecture to automatically color line art videos with the same color style as the given reference images. Our framework consists of a color transform network and a temporal constraint network. The color transform network takes the target line art images as well as the line art and color images of one or more reference images as input, and generates corresponding target color images. To cope with larger differences between the target line art image and reference color images, our architecture utilizes non-local similarity matching to determine the region correspondences between the target image and the reference images, which are used to transform the local color information from the references to the target. To ensure global color style consistency, we further incorporate Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with the transformation parameters obtained from a style embedding vector that describes the global color style of the references, extracted by an embedder. The temporal constraint network takes the reference images and the target image together in chronological order, and learns the spatiotemporal features through 3D convolution to ensure the temporal consistency of the target image and the reference image. Our model can achieve even better coloring results by fine-tuning the parameters with only a small amount of samples when dealing with an animation of a new style. To evaluate our method, we build a line art coloring dataset.

The problem of a sketch to image retrieval and vice-versa is of practical importance, and a trained model in this respect is expected to generalize beyond the training classes, e.g., the zero-shot learning scenario. Nonetheless, considering the drastic distributions-gap between both the modalities, a feature alignment is necessary to learn a shared feature space where retrieval can efficiently be carried out. Additionally, it should also be guaranteed that the shared space is semantically meaningful to aid in the zero-shot retrieval task. The very few existing techniques for zero-shot sketch-RGB image retrieval extend the deep generative models for learning the embedding space; however, training a typical GAN like model for multi-modal image data may be non-trivial at times. To this end, we propose a multi-stream encoder-decoder model that simultaneously ensures improved mapping between the RGB and sketch image spaces and high discrimination in the shared semantics-driven encoded feature space. Further, it is guaranteed that the class topology of the original semantic space is preserved in the encoded feature space, which subsequently reduces the model bias towards the training classes.

Embedding into 2D or 3D space enables visualization; representation in higher-dimensional vector space (typically >100D) enables the application of data mining techniques. For the success of knowledge discovery it is essential that the distances between the embedded vertices truly reflect the structure of the graph. Our fundamental idea is to compress the adjacency matrix by predicting the existence of an edge from the Euclidean distance between the corresponding vertices in the embedding, and to use the achieved compression as a quality measure for the embedding. We call this quality measure Predictive Entropy (PE). PE uses a sigmoid function to define the probability which is monotonically decreasing with the Euclidean distance. We use this sigmoid probability to compress the adjacency matrix of the graph by an entropy coding. While PE could be used to assess the result of any graph drawing or representation learning method we particularly use it as objective function in our new method GEMPE (Graph Embedding by Minimizing the Predictive Entropy). We demonstrate in our experiments that GEMPE clearly outperforms comparison methods with respect to quality of the visual result, clustering and node-labeling accuracy on the discovered coordinates."

Inspired by recent progress toward general-purpose data release algorithms, we propose a private sketch, or small summary of the dataset, that supports a multitude of machine learning tasks including regression, classification, density estimation, near-neighbor search, and more. Our sketch consists of randomized contingency tables that are indexed with locality-sensitive hashing and constructed with an efficient one-pass algorithm. We prove competitive error bounds for DP kernel density estimation. Existing methods for DP kernel density estimation scale poorly, often exponentially slower with an increase in dimensions. In contrast, our sketch can quickly run on large, high-dimensional datasets in a single pass. Exhaustive experiments show that our generic sketch delivers a similar privacy-utility tradeoff when compared to existing DP methods at a fraction of the computation cost. We expect that our sketch will enable differential privacy in distributed, large-scale machine learning settings."

These measurements sample the age-velocity relation (AVR) in galaxy disks. In this first paper we develop two efficient algorithms to extract AD on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis from optical integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) data-cubes. The algorithms apply different spectral templates, one using simple stellar populations and the other a stellar library; their comparison allows us to assess systematic errors in derived multi-component velocities, such as template-mismatch. We test algorithm reliability using mock spectra and Monte Carlo Markov Chains on real data from the MaNGA survey in SDSS-IV. We quantify random and systematic errors in AD as a function of signal-to-noise and stellar population properties with the aim of applying this technique to large subsets of the MaNGA galaxy sample. As a demonstration of our methods, we apply them to an initial sample of seven galaxies with comparable stellar mass and color to the Milky Way. We find a wide range of distinct AD radial profiles for young and old stellar populations."

Due to the large diversity of geometric and texture variations, automatic landmark detection and 3D face reconstruction for caricature is a challenging problem and has rarely been studied before. In this paper, we propose the first automatic method for this task by a novel 3D approach. To this end, we first build a dataset with various styles of 2D caricatures and their corresponding 3D shapes, and then build a parametric model on vertex based deformation space for 3D caricature face. Based on the constructed dataset and the nonlinear parametric model, we propose a neural network based method to regress the 3D face shape and orientation from the input 2D caricature image. Ablation studies and comparison with baseline methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm design, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method works well for various caricatures.

However, lacking in resources to practice US scan, novices often struggle to learn the operation skills. Also, in the deep learning era, automated US image analysis is limited by the lack of annotated samples. Efficiently synthesizing realistic, editable and high resolution US images can solve the problems. The task is challenging and previous methods can only partially complete it. In this paper, we devise a new framework for US image synthesis. Particularly, we firstly adopt a sketch generative adversarial networks (Sgan) to introduce background sketch upon object mask in a conditioned generative adversarial network. With enriched sketch cues, Sgan can generate realistic US images with editable and fine-grained structure details. Although effective, Sgan is hard to generate high resolution US images. To achieve this, we further implant the Sgan into a progressive growing scheme (PGSgan). By smoothly growing both generator and discriminator, PGSgan can gradually synthesize US images from low to high resolution. By synthesizing ovary and follicle US images, our extensive perceptual evaluation, user study and segmentation results prove the promising efficacy and efficiency of the proposed PGSgan."

Contributions in this article are threefold. First, from a proprietary dataset of 119 three-dimensional left-ear scans, a matching dataset of PRTFs was built by performing fast-multipole boundary element method (FM-BEM) calculations. Second, the underlying geometry of each type of high-dimensional data was investigated using principal component analysis. It was found that this linear machine-learning technique performs better at modeling and reducing data dimensionality on ear shapes than on matching PRTF sets. Third, based on these findings, a method was devised to generate an arbitrarily large synthetic database of PRTF sets that relies on the random drawing of ear shapes and subsequent FM-BEM computations."

In this work we focus on their ability to have invariance towards the presence or absence of details. For example, humans are able to watch cartoons, which are missing many visual details, without being explicitly trained to do so. As another example, 3D rendering software is a relatively recent development, yet people are able to understand such rendered scenes even though they are missing details (consider a film like Toy Story). The failure of ma- chine learning algorithms to do this indicates a significant gap in generalization between human abilities and the abilities of deep networks. We propose a dataset that will make it easier to study the detail-invariance problem concretely. We produce a concrete task for this: SketchTransfer, and we show that state-of-the-art domain transfer algorithms still struggle with this task. The state-of-the-art technique which achieves over 95% on MNIST → SVHN transfer only achieves 59% accuracy on the SketchTransfer task, which is much better than random (11% accuracy) but falls short of the 87% accuracy of a classifier trained directly on labeled sketches. This indicates that this task is approachable with today’s best methods but has substantial room for improvement."

Invertible sketches are summary data structures that can recover heavy flows with small memory footprints and bounded errors, yet existing invertible sketches incur high memory access overhead that leads to performance degradation. We present MV-Sketch, a fast and compact invertible sketch that supports heavy flow detection with small and static memory allocation. MV-Sketch tracks candidate heavy flows inside the sketch data structure via the idea of majority voting, such that it incurs small memory access overhead in both update and query operations, while achieving high detection accuracy. We present theoretical analysis on the memory usage, performance, and accuracy of MV-Sketch in both local and network-wide scenarios. We further show how MV-Sketch can be implemented and deployed on P4-based programmable switches subject to hardware deployment constraints. We conduct evaluation in both software and hardware environments. Trace-driven evaluation in software shows that MV-Sketch achieves higher accuracy than existing invertible sketches, with up to $3.38\times $ throughput gain.

In particular, we utilize a teacher network trained on a large amount of data in a related task to separately learn knowledge of the face photo and knowledge of the face sketch and simultaneously transfer this knowledge to two student networks designed for the face photo-sketch synthesis task. In addition to assimilating the knowledge from the teacher network, the two student networks can mutually transfer their own knowledge to further enhance their learning. To further enhance the perception quality of the synthetic image, we propose a KD+ model that combines GANs with KD.

More specifically, we first adopt a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to extract class-wise representations from unpaired images. These classwise representations are then exploited and incorporated with another CGAN, which are used to generate realistic images from sketches. By incorporating the class-wise representations, our method can leverage both the general class information from unpaired images and the targeted object information from input sketches. Additionally, this network architecture also enables us to take full advantage of widely available unpaired images and learn more accurate class representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate, compared with state-of-the-art image translation methods, our approach can achieve more promising results and synthesize images with significantly better Inception Scores and Fréchet Inception Distance."

We discuss why each of these differences can pose a challenge, and even make a certain class of image-based methods inapplicable. We study alternative solutions to address each of the difference. By doing so, we drive out a few important insights: (i) sparsity commonly results in an incorrect prediction of foreground versus background, (ii) diversity of human styles, if not taken into account, can lead to very poor generalization properties, and finally (iii) unless a dedicated sketching interface is used, one can not expect sketches to match a perspective of a fixed viewpoint. Finally, we compare a set of representative deep single-image modeling solutions and show how their performance can be improved to tackle sketch input by taking into consideration the identified critical differences."

In contrast, inspired by intrinsic image decomposition, we decompose this task into texture synthesis and shading enhancement. In particular, we propose a novel bi-colored edge texture representation to synthesize textured garment images and a shading enhancer to render shading based on the grayscale edges. The bi-colored edge representation provides simple but effective texture cues and color constraints, so that the details can be better reconstructed.

Operating at the patch level necessitates special consideration of full sketch translation, as individual translation of patches with no regard to neighbors is likely to produce visible seams and artifacts at patch borders. Aligned pairs of styled and plain primitives are combined to form input hybrids containing styled elements around the border and plain elements within, and given as input to a seamless translation (ST) generator, whose output patches are expected to reconstruct the fully styled patch.

In this paper, we address any-shot, i.e. zero-shot and few-shot, sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) tasks, where we introduce the few-shot setting for SBIR. For solving these tasks, we propose a semantically aligned paired cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (SEM-PCYC) for any-shot SBIR, where each branch of the generative adversarial network maps the visual information from sketch and image to a common semantic space via adversarial training. Each of these branches maintains cycle consistency that only requires supervision at the category level, and avoids the need of aligned sketch-image pairs.

In this work, we propose the first multi-level density sketch-to-image translation framework, which allows the input sketch to cover a wide range from rough object outlines to micro structures. Moreover, to tackle the problem of noncontinuous representation of multi-level density input sketches, we project the density level into a continuous latent space, which can then be linearly controlled by a parameter. This allows users to conveniently control the densities of input sketches and generation of images. Moreover, our method has been successfully verified on various datasets for different applications including face editing, multi-modal sketch-to-photo translation, and anime colorization, providing coarse-to-fine levels of controls to these applications."

However, existing solutions tend to overfit to sketches, thus requiring professional sketches or even edge maps as input. To address this issue, our key idea is to implicitly model the shape space of plausible face images and synthesize a face image in this space to approximate an input sketch. We take a local-to-global approach. We first learn feature embeddings of key face components, and push corresponding parts of input sketches towards underlying component manifolds defined by the feature vectors of face component samples. We also propose another deep neural network to learn the mapping from the embedded component features to realistic images with multi-channel feature maps as intermediate results to improve the information flow. Our method essentially uses input sketches as soft constraints and is thus able to produce high-quality face images even from rough and/or incomplete sketches. Our tool is easy to use even for non-artists, while still supporting fine-grained control of shape details. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superior generation ability of our system to existing and alternative solutions. The usability and expressiveness of our system are confirmed by a user study."

However, synthesizing photo-realistic images from sketches proves to be an even more challenging task, especially for sensitive applications such as suspect identification. In this work, we propose a novel approach that adopts a generative adversarial network that synthesizes a single sketch into multiple synthetic images with unique attributes like hair color, sex, etc. We incorporate a hybrid discriminator which performs attribute classification of multiple target attributes, a quality guided encoder that minimizes the perceptual dissimilarity of the latent space embedding of the synthesized and real image at different layers in the network and an identity preserving network that maintains the identity of the synthesised image throughout the training process. Our approach is aimed at improving the visual appeal of the synthesised images while incorporating multiple attribute assignment to the generator without compromising the identity of the synthesised image. We synthesised sketches using XDOG filter for the CelebA, WVU Multi-modal and CelebA-HQ datasets and from an auxiliary generator trained on sketches from CUHK, IIT-D and FERET datasets.

Hatsuki’s novelty lies in its aesthetic design, 2D facial expressions, and anime-style behaviors that allows Hatsuki to deliver rich interaction experiences resembling anime-characters. We explain our design implementation process of Hatsuki, followed by our evaluations. In order to explore user impressions and opinions towards Hatsuki, we conducted a questionnaire in the world’s largest anime-figurine event. The results indicate that participants were generally very satisfied with Hatsuki’s design, and proposed various use case scenarios and deployment contexts for Hatsuki. The second evaluation focused on imitation learning, as such a method can provide better interaction ability in the real world and generate rich, context-adaptive behaviors in different situations. We made Hatsuki learn 11 actions, combining voice, facial expressions and motions, through the neural network based policy model with our proposed interface. Results show our approach was successfully able to generate the actions through self-organized contexts, which shows the potential for generalizing our approach in further actions under different contexts.

The large number of IFU spectra for each galaxy are either combined to reach a high signal to noise ratio or used to investigate spatial variations. We use Bayesian inferences based on full spectrum fitting. Our analysis based on Bayesian evidence ratio indicates a strong preference for a model that allows the presence of an old stellar population, and that an improper model for the SFH can significantly underestimate the old population in these galaxies. The addition of NIR photometry to the constraining data can further distinguish between different SFH model families and significantly tighten the constraints on the mass fraction in the old population. On average more than half of the stellar mass in present-day low-mass galaxies formed 8 Gyrs ago, while about 30\% within the past 4 Gyrs. Satellite galaxies on average have formed their stellar mass earlier than central galaxies, and stars in the outer regions of galaxy are younger than those in the central part. Our results suggest that most of the low-mass galaxies have an early episode of active star formation that produces a large fraction of their present stellar mass."

So far all existing 3D caricature generation methods require some information related to caricature as input, e.g., a caricature sketch or 2D caricature. However, this kind of input is difficult to provide by non-professional users. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network model to generate high-quality 3D caricature with a simple face photo as input. The most challenging issue in our system is that the source domain of face photos (characterized by 2D normal faces) is significantly different from the target domain of 3D caricatures (characterized by 3D exaggerated face shapes and texture). To address this challenge, we (1) build a large dataset of 6,100 3D caricature meshes and use it to establish a PCA model in the 3D caricature shape space and (2) detect landmarks in the input face photo and use them to set up correspondence between 2D caricature and 3D caricature shape. Our system can automatically generate high-quality 3D caricatures. In many situations, users want to control the output by a simple and intuitive way, so we further introduce a simple-to-use interactive control with three horizontal and one vertical lines. Experiments and user studies show that our system is easy to use and can generate high-quality 3D caricatures."

Moreover, as handheld devices such as tablets, smartphones, etc. have become more popular, it has become increasingly more convenient for people to hand-draw sketches using this equipment. Hence, sketch recognition is a necessary task to improve the performance of intelligent equipment. In this paper, a sketch recognition learning approach is proposed that is based on the Visual Geometry Group16 Convolutional Neural Network (VGG16 CNN). In particular, in order to diminish the effect of the number of sketches on the learning method, we adopt a strategy of increasing the quantity to improve the diversity and scale of sketches. Initially, sketch features are extracted via the pretrained VGG16 CNN. Additionally, we obtain contextual features based on the traverse stroke scheme. Then, the VGG16 CNN is trained using a joint Bayesian method to update the related network parameters. Moreover, this network has been applied to predict the labels of input sketches in order to automatically recognize the label of a sketch.

In this work we focus on their ability to have invariance towards the presence or absence of details. For example, humans are able to watch cartoons, which are missing many visual details, without being explicitly trained to do so. As another example, 3D rendering software is a relatively recent development, yet people are able to understand such rendered scenes even though they are missing details (consider a film like Toy Story). This capability goes beyond visual data: humans are easily able to recognize isolated melodies from musical pieces when heard for the first time, even if the only piece they've listened to previously is from an orchestra. Thus the failure of machine learning algorithms to do this indicates a significant gap in generalization between human abilities and the abilities of deep networks. We propose a dataset that will make it easier to study the detail-invariance problem concretely. We produce a concrete task for this: SketchTransfer, and we show that state-of-the-art domain transfer algorithms still struggle with this task. The state-of-the-art technique which achieves over 95% on MNIST \xrightarrow SVHN transfer only achieves 59% accuracy on the SketchTransfer task, which is much better than random (11% accuracy) but falls short of the 87% accuracy of a classifier trained directly on labeled sketches.

Comput.,2020,0,"Abstract We propose a novel framework for cross-modal zero-shot learning (ZSL) in the context of sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR). Conventionally, the SBIR schema mainly considers simultaneous mappings among the two image views and the semantic side information. Therefore, it is desirable to consider fine-grained classes mainly in the sketch domain using highly discriminative and semantically rich feature space. However, the existing deep generative modeling based SBIR approaches majorly focus on bridging the gaps between the seen and unseen classes by generating pseudo-unseen-class samples. Besides, violating the ZSL protocol by not utilizing any unseen-class information during training, such techniques do not pay explicit attention to modeling the discriminative nature of the shared space. Also, we note that learning a unified feature space for both the multi-view visual data is a tedious task considering the significant domain difference between sketches and the color images. In this respect, as a remedy, we introduce a novel framework for zero-shot SBIR. While we define a cross-modal triplet loss to ensure the discriminative nature of the shared space, an innovative cross-modal attention learning strategy is also proposed to guide feature extraction from the image domain exploiting information from the respective sketch counterpart. In order to preserve the semantic consistency of the shared space, we consider a graph CNN based module which propagates the semantic class topology to the shared space. To ensure an improved response time during inference, we further explore the possibility of representing the shared space in terms of hash-codes. Experimental results obtained on the benchmark TU-Berlin and the Sketchy datasets confirm the superiority of CrossATNet in yielding the state-of-the-art results."

The proposed framework modifies the constrained latent space semantics trained on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We employ two latent spaces to control the face appearance and adjust the desired attributes of the generated face. Instead of constraining the translation process by using a reference image, the users can command the model to retouch the generated images by involving the semantic information in the generation process. In this way, our method can manipulate single or multiple face attributes by only specifying attributes to be changed.

The sketched matrix will be much smaller than X while preserving most of its properties. Therefore, count-sketch is widely used for addressing high-dimensionality challenge in machine learning. However, there are two main limitations of count-sketch: (1) The sketching matrix used count-sketch is generated randomly which does not consider any intrinsic data properties of X. This data-oblivious matrix sketching method could produce a bad sketched matrix which will result in low accuracy for subsequent machine learning tasks (e.g.classification); (2) For highly sparse input data, count-sketch could produce a dense sketched data matrix. This dense sketch matrix could make the subsequent machine learning tasks more computationally expensive than on the original sparse data X. To address these two limitations, we first show an interesting connection between count-sketch and k-means clustering by analyzing the reconstruction error of the count-sketch method. Based on our analysis, we propose to reduce the reconstruction error of count-sketch by using k-means clustering algorithm to obtain the low-dimensional sketched matrix. In addition, we propose to solve k-mean clustering using gradient descent with -L1 ball projection to produce a sparse sketched matrix.

Spaxels whose line ratios are most consistent with ionization by galactic H ii regions exhibit a narrow range of dynamically cold line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) peaked around 25 km s−1 corresponding to a galactic thin disk, while those consistent with ionization by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and low-ionization emission-line regions (LI(N)ERs) have significantly broader LOSVDs extending to 200 km s−1. Star-forming, AGN, and LI(N)ER regions are additionally well separated from each other in terms of their stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population age, Hα equivalent width, and typical radius within a given galaxy.

Based on that, a sketch generating system with an assistant convolutional neural network (CNN) predictor to suggest the shape of the next stroke is presented in this paper. In addition, a CNN-based discriminator is introduced to judge the recognizability of the end product. Since the base-line model is ineffective at generating multi-class sketches, we restrict the model to produce one category. Because the image of a cat is easy to identify, we consider cat sketches selected from the QuickDraw data set.

Most of the literature in text detection use bounding box metrics, which are unsuitable for pixel-level evaluation. Thus, we implemented special metrics to evaluate performance. Using these resources, we designed and evaluated a deep network model, outperforming current methods for text detection in manga in most metrics."

Prior works of scene generation rely on static rule-based entity extraction from natural language description. However, this limits the usability of a practical solution. To overcome this limitation, we use one of state-of-the-art architecture - TransformerXL. Instead of rule-based extraction, our framework leverages the rich contextual encoding which allows us to process a larger range (diverse) of possible natural language descriptions. We empirically show how our proposed mechanism generalizes even on novel combinations of object-features during inference. We also show how our framework can jointly generate static and animated 3D scene efficiently. We modify CLEVR to generate a large, scalable dataset - Integrated static and animated 3D scene (Iscene).

Different from the generic image-to-image translation, drawing a caricature automatically is a more challenging task due to the existence of various spacial deformations. Previous caricature generation methods are obsessed with predicting definite image warping from a given photo while ignoring the intrinsic representation and distribution for exaggerations in caricatures. This limits their ability on diverse exaggeration generation. In this paper, we generalize the caricature generation problem from instance-level warping prediction to distribution-level deformation modeling. Based on this assumption, we present the first exploration for unpaired CARIcature generation with Multiple Exaggerations (CariMe). Technically, we propose a Multi-exaggeration Warper network to learn the distribution-level mapping from photo to facial exaggerations. This makes it possible to generate diverse and reasonable exaggerations from randomly sampled warp codes given one input photo. To better represent the facial exaggeration and produce fine-grained warping, a deformation-field-based warping method is also proposed, which helps us to capture more detailed exaggerations than other point-based warping methods. Experiments and two perceptual studies prove the superiority of our method comparing with other state-of-the-art methods, showing the improvement of our work on caricature generation."

At its core, this approach maintains a small sketch graph to capture the essential community structure found in each snapshot of the full network. We demonstrate how the sketch can be used to explicitly identify six key community events which typically occur during network evolution: growth, shrinkage, merging, splitting, birth and death. Based on these detection techniques, we formulate a community detection algorithm which can process a network concurrently exhibiting all processes. One advantage afforded by the sketch-based algorithm is the efficient handling of large networks. Whereas detecting events in the full graph may be computationally expensive, the small size of the sketch allows changes to be quickly assessed. A second advantage occurs in networks containing clusters of disproportionate size. The sketch is constructed such that there is equal representation of each cluster, thus reducing the possibility that the small clusters are lost in the estimate. We present a new standardized benchmark based on the stochastic block model which models the addition and deletion of nodes, as well as the birth and death of communities. When coupled with existing benchmarks, this new benchmark provides a comprehensive suite of tests encompassing all six community events. We provide a set of numerical results demonstrating the advantages of our approach both in run time and in the handling of small clusters."

Such plans consist of electronic components and cables connecting specific ports of the components. Since the machines are configured for each client individually, cable plans need to be drawn automatically. The drawings must be well readable so that technicians can use them to debug the machines. In order to model plug sockets, we introduce port groups; within a group, ports can change their position (which we use to improve the aesthetics of the layout), but together the ports of a group must form a contiguous block. 
We approach the problem of drawing such cable plans by extending the well-known Sugiyama framework such that it incorporates ports and port groups. Since the framework assumes directed graphs, we propose several ways to orient the edges of the given undirected graph. We compare these methods experimentally, both on real-world data and synthetic data that carefully simulates real-world data. We measure the aesthetics of the resulting drawings by counting bends and crossings. Using these metrics, we compare our approach to Kieler [JVLC 2014], a library for drawing graphs in the presence of port constraints."

Given a multi-graph $G$ together with a drawing $\Gamma(G)$ in the plane with only finitely many crossings, we define a face-$k$-coloring of $\Gamma(G)$ to be a coloring of the maximal connected regions of the drawing, the faces, with $k$ colors such that adjacent faces have different colors. By the $4$-color theorem, every drawing of a bridgeless graph has a face-$4$-coloring. A drawing of a graph is facially $2$-colorable if and only if the underlying graph is Eulerian. We show that every graph without degree 1 vertices admits a $3$-colorable drawing. This leads to the natural question which graphs $G$ have the property that each of its drawings has a $3$-coloring. We say that such a graph $G$ is facially $3$-colorable. We derive several sufficient and necessary conditions for this property: we show that every $4$-edge-connected graph and every graph admitting a nowhere-zero $3$-flow is facially $3$-colorable. We also discuss circumstances under which facial $3$-colorability guarantees the existence of a nowhere-zero $3$-flow. On the negative side, we present an infinite family of facially $3$-colorable graphs without a nowhere-zero $3$-flow. On the positive side, we formulate a conjecture which has a surprising relation to a famous open problem by Tutte known as the $3$-flow-conjecture.

First, we show that the statement holds for cylindrical simple drawings. (In a cylindrical drawing, all vertices are placed on two concentric circles and no edge crosses either circle.) Second, we introduce a relaxation of the problem in which the graph is $k$-edge-colored, and the target structure must be hypochromatic, that is, avoid (at least) one color class. In this setting, we show that every $\lceil (n+5)/6\rceil$-edge-colored monotone simple drawing of $K_n$ contains a hypochromatic plane spanning tree.

After that, the inputs and the synthetic frame equipped with established correspondence are fed into an arbitrary-time frame interpolation pipeline to generate and refine additional inbetween frames. Finally, a video post-processing approach is used to further improve the result. Compared to common frame interpolation methods, our approach can address frames with relatively large motion and also has the flexibility to enable users to control the generated video sequences by editing the sketch guidance. By explicitly considering the correspondence between frames and the sketch, our methods can achieve high-quality synthetic results compared with image synthesis methods. Our results show that our system generalizes well to different movie frames, achieving better results than existing solutions."

We assume that one of these groups consists of sufficient training data while the others only contain few samples. Although the cartoon faces of these groups share similar style, the appearances in various groups could still have some specific characteristics, which makes them differ from each other. A major challenge of this task is how to transfer knowledge among groups and learn group-specific characteristics with only few samples. In order to solve this problem, we propose a two-stage training process. First, a basic translation model for the basic group (which consists of sufficient data) is trained. Then, given new samples of other groups, we extend the basic model by creating group-specific branches for each new group. Group-specific branches are updated directly to capture specific appearances for each group while the remaining group-shared parameters are updated indirectly to maintain the distribution of intermediate feature space. In this manner, our approach is capable to generate high-quality cartoon faces for various groups."

Furthermore, the whole computation might need to be repeated if the underlying graph changes some low percentage of edge updates. We present a method inspired by spectral clustering where we instead use matrix sketches derived from random dimension-reducing projections. We show that our method produces embeddings that yield performant clustering results given a fully-dynamic stochastic block model stream using both the fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss and CountSketch transforms. We also discuss the effects of stochastic block model parameters upon the required dimensionality of the subsequent embeddings, and show how random projections could significantly improve the performance of graph clustering in distributed memory."

Based on this architecture, we further explore learning the sketch-oriented semantic representations in two challenging yet practical settings, i.e., hashing retrieval and zero-shot recognition on million-scale sketches. Specifically, we use our dual-branch architecture as a universal representation framework to design two sketch-specific deep models: (i) We propose a deep hashing model for sketch retrieval, where a novel hashing loss is specifically designed to accommodate both the abstract and messy traits of sketches. (ii) We propose a deep embedding model for sketch zero-shot recognition, via collecting a large-scale edge-map dataset and proposing to extract a set of semantic vectors from edge-maps as the semantic knowledge for sketch zero-shot domain alignment.

The spaxels spectra are classified as active-galactic-nucleuslike (AGN-like), H II-region-like (or SF-like), and intermediate (INT) spectra according to their positions on the Baldwin-PhillipsTerlevich (BPT) diagram. There are the following four configurations of the radiation distributions in the circumnuclear regions in (massive) galaxies: 1) AGN+INT, the innermost region of the AGN-like radiation is surrounded by a ring of radiation of the intermediate type; 2) INT, the central area of radiation of the intermediate type; 3) SF+INT, the inner region of the H II-region-like radiation is surrounded by a ring of radiation of the intermediate type; and 4) SF, the central area of the H II-region-like radiation only. The low ionization nuclear emission line regions (LINERs) of configurations 1 and 2 are examined. The spaxel spectra of the LINERs form a sequences on the BPT diagram, that is, they lie along the known AGN-SF mixing line trajectories. The diagnostic line ratios of the spaxels spectra change smoothly with radius, from AGN-like (or INT) line ratios at the galactic center to H II-region-like at larger galactocentric distances. This is in agreement with the paradigm that the LINERs are excited by AGN activity. We found that the AGN and INT radiation in the circumnuclear region is accompanied by an enhanced gas velocity dispersion σgas. The radius of the area of the AGN and INT radiation is similar to the radius of the area with enhanced σgas, and the central σgas,c correlates with the luminosity of the AGN+INT area. We assume that the gas velocity dispersion can serve as an indicator of the AGN activity. An appreciable enhancement of σgas,c was also measured in the SF-type centers of massive galaxies. The values of σgas,c for the SF-type centers partly overlap with those of the AGN-type centers. This suggests that the manifestation of the circumnuclear region as AGN or as SF on the BPT diagram depends not only on the value of σgas,c (the level of the AGN activity) but it is also governed by an additional parameter(s). We find that there is a demarcation line between the positions of the AGN-type and SF-type objects on the central gas velocity dispersion – central Hα surface brightness diagram, in the sense that an object with a given value of σgas,c is an AGN-type only if the central Hα surface brightness is lower than some value."

This paper presents a deep learning based method for image-based search for binary patent images by taking advantage of existing large natural image repositories for image search and sketch-based methods (Sketches are not identical to diagrams, but they do share some characteristics; for example, both imagery types are gray scale (binary), composed of contours, and are lacking in texture).

We then use our small set of manually labeled patent diagram images via transfer learning to adapt the image search from sketches of natural images to diagrams. Our experiment results show the effectiveness of deep learning with transfer learning for detecting near-identical copies in patent images and querying similar images based on content."

Rather than the conventional multi-task learning with fixed weights of tasks, this work proposes an approach to learn the weights of tasks according to the importance of tasks. The proposed multi-task learning with dynamic tasks weights enables to appropriately train the hard task and easy task instead of being stuck in the over-training easy task as conventional methods.

Many machine learning applications indeed need to deal with such large transformed matrices, for example word embedding method in NLP needs to work with the pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix, while the entrywise transformation makes it difficult to apply known linear algebraic tools.

By 2020, the MaNGA Survey --- one of three core programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) --- will have observed a statistically representative sample of 10$^4$ galaxies in the local Universe ($z\lesssim0.15$). In addition to a robust data-reduction pipeline (DRP), MaNGA has developed a data-analysis pipeline (DAP) that provides higher-level data products. To accompany the first public release of its code base and data products, we provide an overview of the MaNGA DAP, including its software design, workflow, measurement procedures and algorithms, performance, and output data model. In conjunction with our companion paper Belfiore et al., we also assess the DAP output provided for 4718 observations of 4648 unique galaxies in the recent SDSS Data Release 15 (DR15). These analysis products focus on measurements that are close to the data and require minimal model-based assumptions. Namely, we provide stellar kinematics (velocity and velocity dispersion), emission-line properties (kinematics, fluxes, and equivalent widths), and spectral indices (e.g., D4000 and the Lick indices). We find that the DAP provides robust measurements and errors for the vast majority ($>$99%) of analyzed spectra. We summarize assessments of the precision and accuracy of our measurements as a function of signal-to-noise, and provide specific guidance to users regarding the limitations of the data. The MaNGA DAP software is publicly available and we encourage community involvement in its development."

Existing works either require aligned sketch-image pairs or inefficient memory fusion layer for mapping the visual information to a semantic space. In this work, we propose a semantically aligned paired cycle-consistent generative (SEM-PCYC) model for zero-shot SBIR, where each branch maps the visual information to a common semantic space via an adversarial training. Each of these branches maintains a cycle consistency that only requires supervision at category levels, and avoids the need of highly-priced aligned sketch-image pairs. A classification criteria on the generators' outputs ensures the visual to semantic space mapping to be discriminating. Furthermore, we propose to combine textual and hierarchical side information via a feature selection auto-encoder that selects discriminating side information within a same end-to-end model.

We importantly advance prior arts by proposing a novel ZS-SBIR scenario that represents a firm step forward in its practical application. The new setting uniquely recognizes two important yet often neglected challenges of practical ZS-SBIR, (i) the large domain gap between amateur sketch and photo, and (ii) the necessity for moving towards large-scale retrieval. We first contribute to the community a novel ZS-SBIR dataset, QuickDraw-Extended, that consists of 330,000 sketches and 204,000 photos spanning across 110 categories. Highly abstract amateur human sketches are purposefully sourced to maximize the domain gap, instead of ones included in existing datasets that can often be semi-photorealistic. We then formulate a ZS-SBIR framework to jointly model sketches and photos into a common embedding space. A novel strategy to mine the mutual information among domains is specifically engineered to alleviate the domain gap. External semantic knowledge is further embedded to aid semantic transfer. We show that, rather surprisingly, retrieval performance significantly outperforms that of state-of-the-art on existing datasets that can already be achieved using a reduced version of our model. We further demonstrate the superior performance of our full model by comparing with a number of alternatives on the newly proposed dataset.

This is significantly more challenging than one-step generation tasks, as such a system must understand the contents of its generated images with respect to the feedback history, the current feedback, as well as the interactions among concepts present in the feedback history. In this work, we present a recurrent image generation model which takes into account both the generated output up to the current step as well as all past instructions for generation.

We describe the algorithmic choices made in the DAP with regards to measuring emission-line properties, and the effect of our adopted strategy of simultaneously fitting the continuum and line emission. The effect of random errors are quantified by studying various fit-quality metrics, idealized recovery simulations and repeat observations. This analysis demonstrates that the emission lines are well-fit in the vast majority of the MaNGA dataset and the derived fluxes and errors are statistically robust. The systematic uncertainty on emission-line properties introduced by the choice of continuum templates is also discussed. In particular, we test the effect of using different stellar libraries and simple stellar-population models on the derived emission-line fluxes and the effect of introducing different tying prescriptions for the emission-line kinematics. We show that these effects can generate large ($>$ 0.2 dex) discrepancies at low signal-to-noise and for lines with low equivalent width (EW); however, the combined effect is noticeable even for H$\alpha$ EW $>$ 6 \AA.

We collect the first large-scale user interface sketch dataset from the development of Swire that researchers can use to develop new sketch-based data-driven design interfaces and applications. Swire achieves high performance for querying user interfaces: for a known validation task it retrieves the most relevant example as within the top-10 results for over 60% of queries. With this technique, for the first time designers can accurately retrieve relevant user interface examples with free-form sketches natural to their design workflows. We demonstrate several novel applications driven by Swire that could greatly augment the user interface design process."

An intelligent sketched face identification system would rely on automatic face sketch synthesis from photographs, thereby avoiding the cost of artists manually drawing sketches. However, conventional face sketch–photo synthesis methods tend to generate sketches that are consistent with the artists’drawing styles. Identity-specific information is often overlooked, leading to unsatisfactory identity verification and recognition performance. In this paper, we discuss the reasons why conventional methods fail to recover identity-specific information. Then, we propose a novel dual-transfer face sketch–photo synthesis framework composed of an inter-domain transfer process and an intra-domain transfer process. In the inter-domain transfer, a regressor of the test photograph with respect to the training photographs is learned and transferred to the sketch domain, ensuring the recovery of common facial structures during synthesis. In the intra-domain transfer, a mapping characterizing the relationship between photographs and sketches is learned and transferred across different identities, such that the loss of identity-specific information is suppressed during synthesis. The fusion of information recovered by the two processes is straightforward by virtue of an ad hoc information splitting strategy. We employ both linear and nonlinear formulations to instantiate the proposed framework. Experiments on The Chinese University of Hong Kong face sketch database demonstrate that compared to the current state-of-the-art the proposed framework produces more identifiable facial structures and yields higher face recognition performance in both the photo and sketch domains."

Most of the existing MOT algorithms are based on the Tracking-by-Detection (TBD) paradigm combined with popular machine learning approaches which largely reduce the human effort to tune algorithm parameters. However, the commonly used supervised learning approaches require the labeled data (e.g., bounding boxes), which is expensive for videos. Also, the TBD framework is usually suboptimal since it is not end-to-end, i.e., it considers the task as detection and tracking, but not jointly. To achieve both label-free and end-to-end learning of MOT, we propose a Tracking-by-Animation framework, where a differentiable neural model first tracks objects from input frames and then animates these objects into reconstructed frames. Learning is then driven by the reconstruction error through backpropagation. We further propose a Reprioritized Attentive Tracking to improve the robustness of data association.

Recently, research interests arise in solving this problem under the more realistic and challenging setting of zero-shot learning. In this paper, we investigate this problem from the viewpoint of domain adaptation which we show is critical in improving feature embedding in the zero-shot scenario. Based on a framework which starts with a pre-trained model on ImageNet and fine-tunes it on the training set of SBIR benchmark, we advocate the importance of preserving previously acquired knowledge, e.g., the rich discriminative features learned from ImageNet, to improve the model's transfer ability. For this purpose, we design an approach named Semantic-Aware Knowledge prEservation (SAKE), which fine-tunes the pre-trained model in an economical way and leverages semantic information, e.g., inter-class relationship, to achieve the goal of knowledge preservation. Zero-shot experiments on two extended SBIR datasets, TU-Berlin and Sketchy, verify the superior performance of our approach. Extensive diagnostic experiments validate that knowledge preserved benefits SBIR in zero-shot settings, as a large fraction of the performance gain is from the more properly structured feature embedding for photo images."

Despite the exciting progresses made in the literature, it retains as an open problem to synthesize high-quality sketches against blurs and deformations. Recent advances in generative adversarial training provide a new insight into face sketch synthesis, from which perspective the existing synthesis pipelines can be fundamentally revisited. In this paper, we present a novel face sketch synthesis method by multidomain adversarial learning (termed MDAL), which overcomes the defects of blurs and deformations toward high-quality synthesis. The principle of our scheme relies on the concept of “interpretation through synthesis.” In particular, we first interpret face photographs in the photodomain and face sketches in the sketch domain by reconstructing themselves respectively via adversarial learning. We define the intermediate products in the reconstruction process as latent variables, which form a latent domain. Second, via adversarial learning, we make the distributions of latent variables being indistinguishable between the reconstruction process of the face photograph and that of the face sketch. Finally, given an input face photograph, the latent variable obtained by reconstructing this face photograph is applied for synthesizing the corresponding sketch. Quantitative comparisons to the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MDAL method."

Since the learned embedding space is domain-specific, these models do not generalise well across categories. This limits the practical applicability of FG-SBIR. In this paper, we identify cross-category generalisation for FG-SBIR as a domain generalisation problem, and propose the first solution. Our key contribution is a novel unsupervised learning approach to model a universal manifold of prototypical visual sketch traits. This manifold can then be used to paramaterise the learning of a sketch/photo representation. Model adaptation to novel categories then becomes automatic via embedding the novel sketch in the manifold and updating the representation and retrieval function accordingly.

A companion catalog, the MDLM-VAC, provides Deep Learning-based morphological classifications for the same galaxies. The MDLM-VAC includes a number of morphological properties (e.g., a TType, and a finer separation between elliptical and S0 galaxies). Combining the MPP- and MDLM-VACs allows to show that the MDLM morphological classifications are more reliable than previous work. It also shows that single-S\'ersic fits to late- and early-type galaxies are likely to return S\'ersic indices of $n \le 2$ and $\ge 4$, respectively, and this correlation between $n$ and morphology extends to the bulge component as well. While the former is well-known, the latter contradicts some recent work suggesting little correlation between $n$-bulge and morphology. Combining both VACs with MaNGA's spatially resolved spectroscopy allows us to study how the stellar angular momentum depends on morphological type.

Invertible sketches are summary data structures that can recover heavy flows with small memory footprints and bounded errors, yet existing invertible sketches incur high memory access overhead that leads to performance degradation. We present MV-Sketch, a fast and compact invertible sketch that supports heavy flow detection with small and static memory allocation. MV-Sketch tracks candidate heavy flows inside the sketch data structure via the idea of majority voting, such that it incurs small memory access overhead in both update and query operations, while achieving high detection accuracy. We present theoretical analysis on the memory usage, performance, and accuracy of MV-Sketch. Trace-driven evaluation shows that MV-Sketch achieves higher accuracy than existing invertible sketches, with up to $3.38 \times$ throughput gain. We also show how to boost the performance of MV-Sketch with SIMD instructions."

Inspired by human painting procedure, which is composed of stroking and color rendering steps, we propose a Sketching-rendering Unconditional Generative Adversarial Network (SkrGAN) to introduce a sketch prior constraint to guide the medical image generation. In our SkrGAN, a sketch guidance module is utilized to generate a high quality structural sketch from random noise, then a color render mapping is used to embed the sketch-based representations and resemble the background appearances. Experimental results show that the proposed SkrGAN achieves the state-of-the-art results in synthesizing images for various image modalities, including retinal color fundus, X-Ray, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

However, such models are prohibitively expensive to train due to the memory blow-up in the last layer. For example, a reasonable softmax layer for the dataset of interest in this paper can easily reach well beyond 100 billion parameters (>400 GB memory). To alleviate this problem, we present Merged-Average Classifiers via Hashing (MACH), a generic K-classification algorithm where memory provably scales at O(logK) without any strong assumption on the classes. MACH is subtly a count-min sketch structure in disguise, which uses universal hashing to reduce classification with a large number of classes to few embarrassingly parallel and independent classification tasks with a small (constant) number of classes. MACH naturally provides a technique for zero communication model parallelism. We experiment with 6 datasets; some multiclass and some multilabel, and show consistent improvement over respective state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, we train an end-to-end deep classifier on a private product search dataset sampled from Amazon Search Engine with 70 million queries and 49.46 million products. MACH outperforms, by a significant margin,the state-of-the-art extreme classification models deployed on commercial search engines: Parabel and dense embedding models. Our largest model has 6.4 billion parameters and trains in less than 35 hours on a single p3.16x machine. Our training times are 7-10x faster, and our memory footprints are 2-4x smaller than the best baselines. This training time is also significantly lower than the one reported by Google's mixture of experts (MoE) language model on a comparable model size and hardware."

In this paper, we propose SketchGAN, a new generative adversarial network (GAN) based approach that jointly completes and recognizes a sketch, boosting the performance of both tasks. Specifically, we use a cascade Encode-Decoder network to complete the input sketch in an iterative manner, and employ an auxiliary sketch recognition task to recognize the completed sketch. Experiments on the Sketchy database benchmark demonstrate that our joint learning approach achieves competitive sketch completion and recognition performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

However, it's still very challenging for translation tasks with the requirement of high-level visual information conversion, such as photo-to-caricature translation that requires satire, exaggeration, lifelikeness and artistry. We present an approach for learning to translate faces in the wild from the source photo domain to the target caricature domain with different styles, which can also be used for other high-level image-to-image translation tasks. In order to capture global structure with local statistics while translation, we design a dual pathway model of cGAN with one global discriminator and one patch discriminator. Beyond standard convolution (Conv), we propose a new parallel convolution (ParConv) to construct Parallel Convolutional Neural Networks (ParCNNs) for both global and patch discriminators, which can combine the information from previous layer with the current layer. For generator, we provide three more extra losses in association with adversarial loss to constrain consistency for generated output itself and with the target. Also the style can be controlled by the input style info vector. Experiments on photo-to-caricature translation of faces in the wild show considerable performance gain of our proposed method over state-of-the-art translation methods as well as its potential real applications."

Using these derived privacy guarantees, we propose a novel sketch-based framework (DiffSketch) for distributed learning, where we compress the transmitted messages via sketches to simultaneously achieve communication efficiency and provable privacy benefits. Our evaluation demonstrates that DiffSketch can provide strong differential privacy guarantees (e.g., $\varepsilon$= 1) and reduce communication by 20-50x with only marginal decreases in accuracy. Compared to baselines that treat privacy and communication separately, DiffSketch improves absolute test accuracy by 5%-50% while offering the same privacy guarantees and communication compression."

Firstly, we propose an intuitive 3D shape representation method to deal with unaligned shapes with arbitrary poses. Specifically, the proposed Segmented Stochastic-viewing Shape Network models discriminative 3D representations by a set of 2D images rendered from multiple views, which are stochastically selected from non-overlapping spatial segments of a 3D sphere. Secondly, Batch-Hard Binary Coding (BHBC) is developed to learn semantics-preserving compact binary codes by mining the hardest samples. The overall framework is jointly learned by developing an alternating iteration algorithm. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks show that DSSH improves both the retrieval efficiency and accuracy remarkably, compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

Our results prove the existence of epsilon-approximation O(sqrt{d}/epsilon) sized coresets for the above problems. This resolves the long-standing open problem regarding the coreset complexity of Gaussian kernel density estimation. We provide two more related but independent results. First, an exponential improvement of the widely used merge-and-reduce trick which gives improved streaming sketches for any low discrepancy problem. Second, an extremely simple deterministic algorithm for finding low discrepancy sequences (and therefore coresets) for any positive semi-definite kernel.

Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been able to generate images of remarkable quality. Unfortunately, adversarially-trained unconditional generator networks have not been successful as image priors. One of the main requirements for a network to act as a generative image prior, is being able to generate every possible image from the target distribution. Adversarial learning often experiences mode-collapse, which manifests in generators that cannot generate some modes of the target distribution. Another requirement often not satisfied is invertibility i.e. having an efficient way of finding a valid input latent code given a required output image. In this work, we show that differently from earlier GANs, the very recently proposed style-generators are quite easy to invert. We use this important observation to propose style generators as general purpose image priors. We show that style generators outperform other GANs as well as Deep Image Prior as priors for image enhancement tasks. The latent space spanned by style-generators satisfies linear identity-pose relations. The latent space linearity, combined with invertibility, allows us to animate still facial images without supervision. Extensive experiments are performed to support the main contributions of this paper."

Most existing face sketch synthesis methods rely on the assumption that facial photographs/sketches form a low-dimensional manifold. Once the training data are insufficient, the manifold could not characterize the identity-specific information that is included in a test photograph but excluded in the training data. Thus, the synthesized sketch would lose this information, such as glasses, earrings, hairstyles, and hairpins. To provide the sufficient data and satisfy the assumption on manifold, we propose a novel face sketch synthesis framework based on deep latent low-rank representation (DLLRR) in this paper. The DLLRR induces the hidden training sketches with the identity-specific information as the hidden data to the insufficient original training sketches as the observed data. And it searches the lowest rank representation on the candidates of a test photograph from the both hidden and observed data. For the strong representational capability of the coupled autoencoder, we leverage it to reveal the hidden data. Experiment results on face photograph–sketch database illustrate that the proposed method can successfully provide the sufficient training data with the identity-specific information.

Most conventional sketch-based modeling systems target smooth shapes and, to counter the ambiguity, put manually-designed priors on the 3D shape; they also typically require clean, vectorized input. Recent approaches attempt to learn those priors from data but often produce low-quality output. Focusing on piecewise-smooth man-made shapes, we address these issues by presenting a deep learning-based system to infer a complete man-made 3D shape from a single bitmap sketch. Given a sketch, our system infers a set of parametric surfaces that realize the drawing in 3D. To capture the piecewise smooth geometry of man-made shapes, we learn a special shape representation---a deformable parametric template composed of Coons patches. Naively training such a system, however, would suffer from lack of data and from self-intersections of the parametric surfaces.

However, it is nontrivial to efficiently train and effectively use the edge maps in an iSBIR system. Particularly, we find that such an edge map based iSBIR system has several major limitations. First, the system has to be pre-trained on a significant amount of edge maps, either from large-scale sketch datasets, e.g., TU-Berlin~\citeeitz2012hdhso, or converted from other large-scale image datasets, e.g., ImageNet-1K\citedeng2009imagenet dataset.

Among many content-based retrieval systems, sketch-based media retrieval systems have attracted attention recently with the proliferation of tablet PCs and smart mobile devices. Sketch-based retrieval requires the user to draw a freehand sketch query, but freehand drawing can be challenging for those with limited drawing skills. This degrades retrieval performance, since successful retrieval depends on the quality of the sketch query image drawn by the user. To address this issue, we propose a real-time stroke guidance for freehand sketch retrieval that continuously displays next-stroke shadow sketches on the canvas based on the user's step-by-step partial strokes. We train a stroke guidance network that learns the mapping between the step-wise stroke relations to predict the user's next stroke. The proposed stroke guidance for freehand sketch retrieval system runs on a five step next-stroke prediction model that identifies candidate next-stroke sketches from a database of millions of sketches. The system retrieves variable number of sketch object classes at different drawing stages. During the initial sketching stage, diverse drawing possibilities are covered by retrieving multiple sketch classes; as the sketching progresses, the intended sketch class is narrowed down to one. Deep binary hashing is employed for efficient similarity matching of relevant next-stroke sketches. We extend the Google QuickDraw dataset to create a five step sketch stroke database. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, which can be utilized for drawing guidance, tracing, and sketch retrieval. Tracing refers to the act of copying the shadowed line of a guiding image by drawing over its lines."

Although deep neural networks have the ability to model images with hierarchical representations by convolution kernels, they cannot automatically extract the structural representations of object categories in a human-perceptible way. Furthermore, sketch images usually have large-scale visual variations caused by the styles of drawing or viewpoints, which make it difficult to develop generalized representations using the fixed computational mode of convolutional kernel. In this paper, our aim is to address the problem of fixed computational mode in feature extraction process without extra supervision. We propose a novel architecture to dynamically discover the object landmarks and learn the discriminative structural representations. Our model is composed of two components: a representative landmark discovering module that localizes the key points on the object and a category-aware representation learning module that develops the category-specific features. Specifically, we develop a structure-aware offset layer to dynamically localize the representative landmarks, which is optimized based on the category labels without extra supervision. After that, a diversity branch is introduced to extract the global discriminative features for each category. Finally, we employ a multi-task loss function to develop an end-to-end trainable architecture. At testing time, we fuse all the predictions with different number of landmarks to achieve the final results. Through extensive experiments, we compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets, TU-Berlin and Sketchy, for sketch classification and retrieval, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model."

Federated learning methods run training tasks directly on user devices and do not share the raw user data with third parties. However, current methods still share model updates, which may contain private information (e.g., one's weight and height), during the training process. Existing efforts that aim to improve the privacy of federated learning make compromises in one or more of the following key areas: performance (particularly communication cost), accuracy, or privacy. To better optimize these trade-offs, we propose that \textit{sketching algorithms} have a unique advantage in that they can provide both privacy and performance benefits while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate the feasibility of sketching-based federated learning with a prototype on three representative learning models. Our initial findings show that it is possible to provide strong privacy guarantees for federated learning without sacrificing performance or accuracy. Our work highlights that there exists a fundamental connection between privacy and communication in distributed settings, and suggests important open problems surrounding the theoretical understanding, methodology, and system design of practical, private federated learning."

The large number of IFU spectra of individual galaxies provide high signal-to-noise composite spectra that are essential for constraining IMF and to investigate possible radial gradients of the IMF within individual galaxies. The large sample of ETGs also make it possible to study how the IMF shape depends on various properties of galaxies. We adopt a novel approach to study IMF variations in ETGs, use Bayesian inferences based on full spectrum fitting. The Bayesian method provides a statistically rigorous way to explore potential degeneracy in spectrum fitting, and to distinguish different IMF models with Bayesian evidence. We find that the IMF slope depends systematically on galaxy velocity dispersion, in that galaxies of higher velocity dispersion prefer a more bottom-heavy IMF, but the dependence is almost entirely due to the change of metallicity, $Z$, with velocity dispersion. The IMF shape also depends on stellar age, $A$, but the dependence is completely degenerate with that on metallicity through a combination $AZ^{-1.42}$. Using independent age and metallicity estimates we find that the IMF variation is produced by metallicity instead of age. The IMF near the centers of massive ETGs appears more bottom-heavy than that in the outer parts, while a weak opposite trend is seen for low-mass ETGs. Uncertainties produced by star formation history, dust extinction, $\alpha$-element abundance enhancement and noise in the spectra are tested."

Detailed studies of a handful of nearby clusters have shown that slow rotators are generally found at the centres of clusters where the number density is highest, whereas the fast rotators trace the trend followed by early-type galaxies of increasing in number with local density. In this paper, we study the environmental distribution of slow and fast rotators using the stellar kinematics of about 3900 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey. For galaxies in groups closer than $z=0.08$ that are not observed with MaNGA but satisfy the necessary conditions for slow rotators, we visually assign slow/fast rotator classifications to obtain a complete sample. Our final catalogue contains about 900 groups of five or more members. We observe the kinematic morphology-density (kT-$\Sigma$) relation for each group and find an increasing fraction of massive slow rotators with increasing number density. We provide evidence suggesting that the observed lack of trends in angular momentum with environment at fixed stellar mass is partly because the maximum density varies between clusters, and that the locations of massive slow rotators are strongly correlated with peak densities in galaxy groups and clusters. We conclude that the (projected) number density relative to the cluster peak is more fundamental than the absolute number density in influencing the abundance of slow rotators. We find that the kT-$\Sigma$ relation does exist at fixed stellar mass, and we rule out the hypothesis that the kT-$\Sigma$ relation is a result of dynamical friction alone, instead arguing that massive slow rotators grow hierarchically in tandem with their host clusters."

However, the majority of existing person re-id methods are not designed for processing sequential data in an online way. This ignores the real-world scenario that person images detected from multi-cameras system are coming sequentially. While there is a few work on discussing online re-id, most of them require considerable storage of all passed data samples that have been ever observed, and this could be unrealistic for processing data from a large camera network. In this work, we present an onepass person re-id model that adapts the re-id model based on each newly observed data and no passed data are directly used for each update. More specifically, we develop an Sketch online Discriminant Analysis (SoDA) by embedding sketch processing into Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA). SoDA can efficiently keep the main data variations of all passed samples in a low rank matrix when processing sequential data samples, and estimate the approximate within-class variance (i.e. within-class covariance matrix) from the sketch data information. We provide theoretical analysis on the effect of the estimated approximate within-class covariance matrix. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the Fisher discriminant score (i.e. the quotient between between-class variation and within-class variation after feature transformation) in order to investigate how the optimal feature transformation learned by SoDA sequentially approximates the offline FDA that is learned on all observed data. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our SoDA and empirically support our theoretical analysis."

To overcome these challenges, we propose a deep embedding model for scene sketch zero-shot learning.

The first obstacle to achieving this goal is the lack of large-scale datasets with grouping annotation. To overcome this, we contribute the largest sketch perceptual grouping dataset to date, consisting of 20 000 unique sketches evenly distributed over 25 object categories.

These sketches erase gracefully; even if we erase a fraction of the sketch at random, the remainder still retains the `high-weight' information present in the original sketch. The sketches can also be organized in a repository to implicitly form a `knowledge graph'; it is possible to quickly retrieve sketches in the repository that are related to a sketch of interest; arranged in this fashion, the sketches can also be used to learn emerging concepts by looking for new clusters in sketch space. Finally, in the scenario where we want to learn a ground truth deep network, we show that augmenting input/output pairs with these sketches can theoretically make it easier to do so."

The two generators form a W-shaped network (W-net) and they are trained jointly with a weight-sharing constraint. Additionally, we also propose two novel discriminators, the residual one focusing on attribute generation and the triplex one helping to generate realistic looking sketches. To validate our model, we have created a new large dataset with 8,804 images, named the Attribute Face Photo & Sketch (AFPS) dataset which is the first dataset containing attributes associated to face sketch images.

However, due to the great difference between face photos and sketches, as well as the cluttered backgrounds in photo images, there tends to be some noise, deformation and missing parts on the synthesized face sketches by most of the exemplar-based methods. Besides, most exemplar-based methods exist a common problem: they only produce satisfactory results when training and test samples originate from the same dataset. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a simple but effective method which consists of two stages: the preprocessing stage and the sketch synthesis stage. In the preprocessing stage, we first design a fully convolutional neural network for preprocessing (pFCN). To fit the preprocessing task, the pFCN is trained by an L1 based total loss function, which is simple yet could enhance the facial features. Then the full-size photo is fed to the well-trained pFCN to generate the feature map, which we call a semi-sketch since it bridges the discrepancy between photo and sketch. At the sketch synthesis stage, the semi-sketches and an existing exemplar-based method are employed to synthesize the final sketches. Extensive experiments on public face sketch datasets verify that the proposed two-stage method improves the sketch synthesis quality of the state-of-the-art exemplar-based methods in terms of both recognition accuracy and perceptual quality. In addition, the experiments on cross-dataset indicate that the proposed method provides a new means for strengthening the generalization ability of the exemplar-based method."

To address this problem, in this paper we propose Cali-Sketch, a poorly-drawn-sketch to photo-realistic-image generation method. Cali-Sketch explicitly models stroke calibration and image generation using two constituent networks: a Stroke Calibration Network (SCN), which calibrates strokes of facial features and enriches facial details while preserving the original intent features; and an Image Synthesis Network (ISN), which translates the calibrated and enriched sketches to photo-realistic face images.

The image modal component SketchNet learns hierarchically abstract ro-bust features and utilizes multi-level representations to produce pixel-wise feature maps, while the point set-modal component SPointNet captures local and global contexts of the sampled point set to produce point-wise feature maps. Then our framework aggregates these feature maps by a fusion network component to generate the sketch segmentation result. The extensive experimental evaluation and comparison with peer methods on our large SketchSeg dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

Tax payments are collected according to the very general loss-carry-forward tax system introduced in Kyprianou and Zhou (2009). To achieve a balance between taxation optimization and solvency, we consider an interesting modified objective function by considering the expected accumulated discounted tax payments of the company until the general draw-down time, instead of until the classical ruin time. The optimal tax return function and the optimal tax strategy are derived, and some numerical examples are also provided."

However, translating natural language text into animation is a challenging task. Existing text-to-animation systems can handle only very simple sentences, which limits their applications. In this paper, we develop a text-to-animation system which is capable of handling complex sentences. We achieve this by introducing a text simplification step into the process. Building on an existing animation generation system for screenwriting, we create a robust NLP pipeline to extract information from screenplays and map them to the system's knowledge base. We develop a set of linguistic transformation rules that simplify complex sentences. Information extracted from the simplified sentences is used to generate a rough storyboard and video depicting the text. Our sentence simplification module outperforms existing systems in terms of BLEU and SARI metrics.We further evaluated our system via a user study: 68 % participants believe that our system generates reasonable animation from input screenplays."

It is a challenging task; because sketches are drawn by non-professionals and only consist of strokes, they usually exhibit shape deformation and lack visual cues, i.e., colors and textures. Thus translation from sketch to photo involves two aspects: shape and color (texture). Existing methods cannot handle this task well, as they mostly focus on solving one translation. In this work, we show that the key to this task lies in decomposing the translation into two subtasks, shape translation and colorization. Correspondingly, we propose a model consisting of two sub-networks, with each one tackling one sub-task. We also find that, when translating shapes, specific drawing styles affect the generated results significantly and may even lead to failure. To make our model more robust to drawing style variations, we design a data augmentation strategy and re-purpose an attention module, aiming to make our model pay less attention to distracted regions of a sketch. Besides, a conditional module is adapted for color translation to improve diversity and increase users’ control over the generated results. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons are presented to show the superiority of our approach. In addition, as a side benefit, our model can synthesize high-quality sketches from photos inversely. We also demonstrate how these generated photos and sketches can benefit other applications, such as sketch-based image retrieval."

Transforming sketches of a Graphical User Interface (UI) into a coded UI application is an uninspired but time-consuming task performed by a UI designer. An automated system that can replace human efforts for straightforward implementation of UI designs will greatly speed up this procedure. The works that propose such a system primarily focus on using UI wireframes as input rather than hand-drawn sketches. In this paper, we put forward a novel approach wherein we employ a Deep Neural Network that is trained on our custom database of such sketches to detect UI elements in the input sketch. Detection of objects in sketches is a peculiar visual recognition task that requires a specific solution that our deep neural network model attempts to provide. The output from the network is a platform-independent UI representation object. The UI representation object is a dictionary of key-value pairs to represent the UI elements recognized along with their properties. This is further consumed by our UI parser which creates code for different platforms. The intrinsic platform-independence allows the model to create a UI prototype for multiple platforms with single training. This two-step approach without the need for two trained models improves over other methods giving time-efficient results (average time: 129 ms) with good accuracy."

The co-creative sketching tool maps a user's sketch to a sketch of a distinct category that has high, medium, or low visual and semantic similarity. We hypothesize that the degree of similarity between the user's and the system's sketches is associated with a range of cognitive models of creativity in a design context. We report on the findings of an empirical study that analyzes different design scenarios in which the user sketches in response to a proposed conceptual shift. The findings show that how similar the computational agent's sketch is to the user's original sketch is related to the presence of three types of design creativity in the user's response: combinatorial, exploratory, and transformational."

However creating a meaningful and understandable sketch drawing is not always an easy task especially for unskillful users. Existing methods for rendering 3D shape into line drawings such as Suggestive Contours, only consider the geometry-dependent and view-dependent information thus leads to over-regular or over-perfect results which doesn’t look like a human freehand drawing. For this challenge we address the problem of producing freehand line drawing sketches from a 3D object under a given viewpoint automatically. The core solution here is a recurrent generative deep neural network, which learns a functional mapping from the suggestive contours of a 3D shape to a more abstract sketch representation. We drop the encoder of the generator, i.e., use only a decoder to achieve better stability of the sketch structure. Users can tune the level of freehand style of the generated sketches by changing a single parameter. Experiments show that our results are expressive enough to faithfully describe the input shape and at the same time be with the style of freehand drawings created by a real human. We also perform a comparative user study to verify the quality and style of generated sketch results over existing methods. We also retrain our network using several different mingled dataset to test the extendibility of our method for this particular application. As far as our knowledge this work is the first research effort to automate the generation of human-like freehand sketches directly from 3D shapes."

In this paper we present a novel Human-to-Animation conditional Generative Adversarial Network (HA-GAN) to overcome these two problems by using many (human faces) to one (animated face) mapping. Specifically, for any given input human expression image, our HA-GAN transfers the expression information from the input image to a fixed animated identity. Stylized animated characters from the Facial Expression Research Group-Database (FERGDB) are used for the generation of fixed identity. By learning this many-to-one identity mapping function using our proposed HA-GAN, the effect of inter-subject variations can be reduced in Facial Expression Recognition(FER). We also argue that the expressions in the generated animated images are pure expressions and since FER is performed on these generated images, the performance of facial expression recognition is improved. Our initial experimental results on the state-of-the-art datasets show that facial expression recognition carried out on the generated animated images using our HA-GAN framework outperforms the baseline deep neural network and produces comparable or even better results than the state-of-the-art methods for facial expression recognition."

More specifically, we first design a cycle-like architecture to enable training with unpaired data. Then we design three losses from different aspects. A total variation loss is used to highlight important edges and contents in cartoon portraits. An attentive cycle loss is added to lay more emphasis on delicate facial areas such as eyes. In addition, a perceptual loss is included to eliminate artifacts and improve robustness of our method.

Recently, Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR) has drawn a lot of attention due to its ability to retrieve the novel/unseen class images at test time. These methods try to project sketch features into the image domain by learning a distribution conditioned on the sketch. We propose a new framework for ZS-SBIR that models joint distribution between the sketch and image domain using a generative adversarial network. The joint distribution modeling ability of our generative model helps to reduce the domain gap between the sketches and images. Our framework helps to synthesize the novel class image features using sketch features. The generative ability of our model for the unseen/novel classes, conditioned on sketch feature, allows it to perform well on the seen as well as unseen class sketches.

First, we introduce a new idea named homogeneous transformation to address the problem of domain adaptation. For the task of sketch parsing, there is no available data of labeled freehand sketches that can be directly used for model training. An alternative solution is to learn from the existing parsing data of real images, while the domain adaptation is an inevitable problem. Unlike existing methods that utilize the edge maps of real images to approximate freehand sketches, the proposed homogeneous transformation method transforms the data from two different domains into a homogeneous space to minimize the semantic gap. Second, we design a soft-weighted loss function as guidance for the training process, which gives attention to both the ambiguous label boundary and class imbalance. Third, we present a staged learning strategy to improve the parsing performance of the trained model, which takes advantage of the shared information and specific characteristic from different sketch categories. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods. Specifically, to evaluate the generalization ability of our homogeneous transformation method, additional experiments at the task of sketch-based image retrieval are conducted on the QMUL FG-SBIR dataset.

Machine can be trained to mimic the human drawing process using a training set of aligned image-sketch pairs. However, to collect such paired data is quite expensive or even unavailable for many cases since sketches exhibit various level of abstractness and drawing preferences. Hence we present an approach for learning an image-to-sketch translation network via unpaired examples. A translation network, which can translate the representation in image latent space to sketch domain, is trained in unsupervised setting. To prevent the problem of representation shifting in cross-domain translation, a novel cycle+ consistency loss is explored. Experimental results on sketch recognition and sketch-based image retrieval demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Trees are an interesting shape class because they exhibit complexity and variations that are well-suited to measure the ability of a generative model to generated detailed structures. We propose a new dataset for this task and demonstrate that state-of-the-art generative models fail to synthesise realistic images on our benchmark, even though they perform well on current datasets like MNIST digits. Motivated by these results, we propose a novel network architecture based on combining a variational autoencoder using Recurrent Neural Networks and a convolutional discriminator. The network, error metrics and training procedure are adapted to the task of fine-grained sketching. Through quantitative and perceptual experiments, we show that our model outperforms previous work and that our dataset is a valuable benchmark for generative models.

We prove that G has a Stick representation if and only if there are orderings of A and B such that G's bipartite adjacency matrix with rows A and columns B excludes three small ‘forbidden’ submatrices. This is similar to characterizations for other classes of bipartite intersection graphs. We present an algorithm to test whether given orderings of A and B permit a Stick representation respecting those orderings, and to find such a representation if it exists. The algorithm runs in time linear in the size of the adjacency matrix.

However, specifying a detailed 3D shape by a sketch on the first try without reference (i.e., 3D model or real object) is difficult. In this paper, we aim at a sketch-based 3D shape retrieval system that tolerates coarsely drawn or incomplete sketches having small number of strokes. Such a system could be used to start a sketch-retrieve-refine interactive loop that could lead to a 3D shape having required shape details. Proposed algorithm uses deep feature embedding into common feature embedding space to compare sketches and 3D shape models. To handle coarse or incomplete sketches, a sketch, which is a sequence of strokes, is augmented by removing stroke for training a pair of DNNs to extract sketch features. A sketch feature is a fusion of an image based feature extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a 2D point sequence feature extracted by using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Embedding of 3D shape feature and the sketch feature is learned by using triplet loss. Experimental evaluation of the proposed method is performed using (simulated) incomplete sketches created by removing part of their strokes. The experiments show that sketch stroke removal augmentation significantly improved retrieval accuracy if queried by using such incomplete sketches."

Conventional methods for this task often rely on the availability of the temporal order of sketch strokes, additional cues acquired from different modalities and supervised augmentation of sketch datasets with real images, which also limit the applicability and feasibility of these methods in real scenarios. 
In this paper, we propose a novel sketch-specific data augmentation (SSDA) method that leverages the quantity and quality of the sketches automatically. From the aspect of quantity, we introduce a Bezier pivot based deformation (BPD) strategy to enrich the training data. Towards quality improvement, we present a mean stroke reconstruction (MSR) approach to generate a set of novel types of sketches with smaller intra-class variances. Both of these solutions are unrestricted from any multi-source data and temporal cues of sketches. Furthermore, we show that some recent deep convolutional neural network models that are trained on generic classes of real images can be better choices than most of the elaborate architectures that are designed explicitly for sketch recognition. As SSDA can be integrated with any convolutional neural networks, it has a distinct advantage over the existing methods. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results (84.27%) on the TU-Berlin dataset, outperforming the human performance by a remarkable 11.17% increase.

The high-mix / low-volume production forces constant accommodations of unknown product variants, which ultimately leads to high periods of machine calibration. The difficulty related with machine calibration is that experience is required together with a set of experiments to meet the final product quality. Unfortunately, all possible combinations of machine parameters is so high that is difficult to build empirical knowledge. Due to this fact, normally trial and error approaches are taken making one-of-a-kind products not viable. Therefore, a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) based approach called hyper-process model (HPM) to learn the relation among multiple tasks is used as a way to shorten the calibration phase. Assuming each product variant is a task to solve, first, a shape analysis on data to learn common modes of deformation between tasks is made, and secondly, a mapping between these modes and task descriptions is performed. Ultimately, the present work has two main contributions: 1) Formulation of an industrial problem into a ZSL setting where new process models can be generated for process optimization and 2) the definition of a regression problem in the domain of ZSL. For that purpose, a 2-d deep drawing simulated process was used based on data collected from the Abaqus simulator, where a significant number of process models were collected to test the effectiveness of the approach. The obtained results show that is possible to learn new tasks without any available data (both labeled and unlabeled) by leveraging information about already existing tasks, allowing to speed up the calibration phase and make a quicker integration of new products into manufacturing systems."

We collected the human fixations of ten subjects from 498 natural images and of another ten subjects from the corresponding 996 human-marked line drawings of boundaries (two boundary maps per image) under free-viewing condition. The experimental results show that with the absence of some basic features like color and luminance, the distribution of the fixations on the line drawings has a high correlation with that on the natural images. Moreover, compared to the basic cues of regions, subjects pay more attention to the closed regions of line drawings which are usually related to the dominant objects of the scenes. Finally, we built a computational model to demonstrate that the fixation information on the line drawings can be used to significantly improve the performances of classical bottom-up models for fixation prediction in natural scenes.

This paper proposes a method that can create a high-resolution, long-term animation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from a single landscape image where we mainly focus on skies and waters. Our key observation is that the motion (e.g., moving clouds) and appearance (e.g., time-varying colors in the sky) in natural scenes have different time scales. We thus learn them separately and predict them with decoupled control while handling future uncertainty in both predictions by introducing latent codes. Unlike previous methods that infer output frames directly, our CNNs predict spatially-smooth intermediate data, i.e., for motion, flow fields for warping, and for appearance, color transfer maps, via self-supervised learning, i.e., without explicitly-provided ground truth. These intermediate data are applied not to each previous output frame, but to the input image only once for each output frame. This design is crucial to alleviate error accumulation in long-term predictions, which is the essential problem in previous recurrent approaches. The output frames can be looped like cinemagraph, and also be controlled directly by specifying latent codes or indirectly via visual annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comparisons with the state-of-the-arts on video prediction as well as appearance manipulation.

To this end, inspired by the literature of graph drawing we propose a novel graph-preserving grid layout (GPGL), an integer programming that minimizes the topological loss on the grid. Technically we propose solving GPGL approximately using a {\em regularized} Kamada-Kawai algorithm, a well-known nonconvex optimization technique in graph drawing, with a vertex separation penalty that improves the rounding performance on top of the solutions from relaxation. Using GPGL we can easily conduct data augmentation as every local minimum will lead to a grid layout for the same graph.

Prior work proposed attacks that infer participant's privacy from gradients and parameters, and they showed simple defenses like dropout and differential privacy do not help much. 
To defend privacy leakage, we propose a method called Double Blind Collaborative Learning (DBCL) which is based on random matrix sketching. The high-level idea is to apply a random transformation to the parameters, data, and gradients in every iteration so that the existing attacks will fail or become less effective. While it improves the security of collaborative ML, DBCL does not increase the computation and communication cost much and does not hurt prediction accuracy at all.

While most existing works focus on 3D caricature reconstruction from 2D caricatures or translating 2D photos to 2D caricatures, this paper presents a real-time and automatic algorithm for creating expressive 3D caricatures with caricature style texture map from 2D photos or videos. To solve this challenging ill-posed reconstruction problem and cross-domain translation problem, we first reconstruct the 3D face shape for each frame, and then translate 3D face shape from normal style to caricature style by a novel identity and expression preserving VAE-CycleGAN. Based on a labeling formulation, the caricature texture map is constructed from a set of multi-view caricature images generated by CariGANs. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are demonstrated by comparison with baseline implementations. The perceptual study shows that the 3D caricatures generated by our method meet people's expectations of 3D caricature style."

The sketch-based query, which enjoys the flexibility in representing the user’s intention, has received growing interests in recent years due to the popularization of the touchscreen technology. Essentially, the sketch depicts an abstraction of an shape in a certain view while the shape contains the full 3D information. Matching between them is a cross-modality retrieval problem, and the state-of-the-art solution is to project the sketch and the 3D shape into a common space with which the cross-modality similarity can be calculated by the feature similarity/distance within. However, for a given query, only part of the viewpoints of the 3D shape is representative. Thus, blindly projecting a 3D shape into a feature vector without considering what is the query will inevitably bring query-unrepresentative information. To handle this issue, in this paper we propose a Deep Point-to-Subspace Metric Learning (DPSML) framework to project a sketch into a feature vector and a 3D shape into a subspace spanned by a few selected basis feature vectors. The similarity between them is defined as the distance between the query feature vector and its closest point in the subspace by solving an optimization problem on the fly. Note that, the closest point is query-adaptive and can reflect the viewpoint information that is representative to the given query.

Various approaches have been proposed and achieved highly desirable results. Nevertheless, its accomplishment requires abundant paired training data which are expensive to acquire. Therefore, models for translation are usually trained on a set of paired training data which are carefully and laboriously designed. Our work is focused on learning through automatically generated paired data. We propose a method to generate fake sketches from images using an adversarial network and then pair the images with corresponding fake sketches to form large-scale multi-class paired training data for training a sketch-to-image translation model. Our model is an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder generates fake sketches from images and the decoder performs sketch-to-image translation. Qualitative results show that the encoder can be used for generating large-scale multi-class paired data under low supervision. Our current dataset now contains 61255 image and (fake) sketch pairs from 256 different categories. These figures can be greatly increased in the future thanks to our weak reliance on manually labelled data."

Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world. Previous research has mainly focused on recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However, recognition is only one aspect for understanding a language, another challenging and interesting task is to teach a machine to automatically write (pictographic) Chinese characters. In this paper, we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network (RNN) as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and a generative model for drawing (generating) Chinese characters. To recognize Chinese characters, previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neural network (CNN) models which require transforming the online handwriting trajectory into image-like representations. Instead, our RNN based approach is an end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure and does not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the RNN system (combining an LSTM and GRU), state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the ICDAR-2013 competition database. Furthermore, under the RNN framework, a conditional generative model with character embedding is proposed for automatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters (in vector format) are human-readable and also can be recognized by the discriminative RNN model with high accuracy. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of using RNNs as both generative and discriminative models for the tasks of drawing and recognizing Chinese characters."

Our solution belongs to learning based methods, which have recently become popular to stylize images in artistic forms such as painting. However, existing methods do not produce satisfactory results for cartoonization, due to the fact that (1) cartoon styles have unique characteristics with high level simplification and abstraction, and (2) cartoon images tend to have clear edges, smooth color shading and relatively simple textures, which exhibit significant challenges for texture-descriptor-based loss functions used in existing methods. In this paper, we propose CartoonGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework for cartoon stylization. Our method takes unpaired photos and cartoon images for training, which is easy to use. Two novel losses suitable for cartoonization are proposed: (1) a semantic content loss, which is formulated as a sparse regularization in the high-level feature maps of the VGG network to cope with substantial style variation between photos and cartoons, and (2) an edge-promoting adversarial loss for preserving clear edges. We further introduce an initialization phase, to improve the convergence of the network to the target manifold. Our method is also much more efficient to train than existing methods. Experimental results show that our method is able to generate high-quality cartoon images from real-world photos (i.e., following specific artists' styles and with clear edges and smooth shading) and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

The proposed interface runs in real-time and facilitates an interactive and iterative workflow to quickly express the intended edits.

Two challenges in such conditional program generation are that the generated programs must satisfy a rich set of syntactic and semantic constraints, and that source code contains many low-level features that impede learning. We address these problems by training a neural generator not on code but on program sketches, or models of program syntax that abstract out names and operations that do not generalize across programs. During generation, we infer a posterior distribution over sketches, then concretize samples from this distribution into type-safe programs using combinatorial techniques. We implement our ideas in a system for generating API-heavy Java code, and show that it can often predict the entire body of a method given just a few API calls or data types that appear in the method."

It generally consists of two parts: neighbor selection and reconstruction weight representation. The most time-consuming or main computation complexity for exemplar-based face sketch synthesis methods lies in the neighbor selection process. State-of-the-art face sketch synthesis methods perform neighbor selection online in a data-driven manner by $K$ nearest neighbor ($K$-NN) searching. Actually, the online search increases the time consuming for synthesis. Moreover, since these methods need to traverse the whole training dataset for neighbor selection, the computational complexity increases with the scale of the training database and hence these methods have limited scalability. In this paper, we proposed a simple but effective offline random sampling in place of online $K$-NN search to improve the synthesis efficiency. Extensive experiments on public face sketch databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both synthesis quality and time consumption.

Most existing SBIR studies do not directly tackle this cross-modal problem. This naturally motivates us to explore the effectiveness of cross-modal retrieval methods in SBIR, which have been applied in the image-text matching successfully. In this paper, we introduce and compare a series of state-of-the-art cross-modal subspace learning methods and benchmark them on two recently released fine-grained SBIR datasets.

Ideally, an SBIR model should learn to associate components in the sketch (say, feet, tail, etc.) with the corresponding components in the image having similar shape characteristics. However, current evaluation methods simply focus only on coarse-grained evaluation where the focus is on retrieving images which belong to the same class as the sketch but not necessarily having the same shape characteristics as in the sketch. As a result, existing methods simply learn to associate sketches with classes seen during training and hence fail to generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark for zero-shot SBIR where the model is evaluated on novel classes that are not seen during training. We show through extensive experiments that existing models for SBIR that are trained in a discriminative setting learn only class specific mappings and fail to generalize to the proposed zero-shot setting. To circumvent this, we propose a generative approach for the SBIR task by proposing deep conditional generative models that take the sketch as an input and fill the missing information stochastically. Experiments on this new benchmark created from the “Sketchy” dataset, which is a large-scale database of sketch-photo pairs demonstrate that the performance of these generative models is significantly better than several state-of-the-art approaches in the proposed zero-shot framework of the coarse-grained SBIR task."

Our method can generate videos which have (a) lip movements that are in sync with the audio and (b) natural facial expressions such as blinks and eyebrow movements.

The effect of each component in our system is quantified through an ablation study. The generated videos are evaluated based on their sharpness, reconstruction quality, and lip-reading accuracy.

Recent GAN-based methods have shown promising results on image-to-image translation problems and photo-to-sketch synthesis in particular, however, they are known to have limited abilities in generating high-resolution realistic images.

At the core of our approach is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts occupancy of a voxel grid from a line drawing. This CNN provides an initial 3D reconstruction as soon as the user completes a single drawing of the desired shape. We complement this single-view network with an updater CNN that refines an existing prediction given a new drawing of the shape created from a novel viewpoint. A key advantage of our approach is that we can apply the updater iteratively to fuse information from an arbitrary number of viewpoints, without requiring explicit stroke correspondences between the drawings. We train both CNNs by rendering synthetic contour drawings from hand-modeled shape collections as well as from procedurally-generated abstract shapes. Finally, we integrate our CNNs in an interactive modeling system that allows users to seamlessly draw an object, rotate it to see its 3D reconstruction, and refine it by re-drawing from another vantage point using the 3D reconstruction as guidance."

Wasserstein distance is used in training cGAN to overcome model collapse and enable the model converged much better.

Instead of following the conventional sketch recognition task, we introduce the novel problem of sketch hashing retrieval which is not only more challenging, but also offers a better testbed for large-scale sketch analysis, since: (i) more fine-grained sketch feature learning is required to accommodate the large variations in style and Abstraction, and (ii) a compact binary code needs to be learned at the same time to enable efficient retrieval. Key to our network design is the embedding of unique characteristics of human sketch, where (i) a two-branch CNN-RNN architecture is adapted to explore the temporal ordering of strokes, and (ii) a novel hashing loss is specifically designed to accommodate both the temporal and Abstract traits of sketches. By working with a 3.8M sketch dataset, we show that state-of-the-art hashing models specifically engineered for static images fail to perform well on temporal sketch data.

In this paper, we present a novel approach for translating an object photo to a sketch, mimicking the human sketching process. This is an extremely challenging task because the photo and sketch domains differ significantly. Furthermore, human sketches exhibit various levels of sophistication and abstraction even when depicting the same object instance in a reference photo. This means that even if photo-sketch pairs are available, they only provide weak supervision signal to learn a translation model. Compared with existing supervised approaches that solve the problem of D(E(photo)) â†’ sketch), where E(Â·) and D(Â·) denote encoder and decoder respectively, we take advantage of the inverse problem (e.g., D(E(sketch) â†’ photo), and combine with the unsupervised learning tasks of within-domain reconstruction, all within a multi-task learning framework. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches based on cycle consistency (i.e., D(E(D(E(photo)))) â†’ photo), we introduce a shortcut consistency enforced at the encoder bottleneck (e.g., D(E(photo)) â†’ photo) to exploit the additional self-supervision.

When the input sketch is badly drawn, the output of common image-to-image translation follows the input edges due to the hard condition imposed by the translation process. Instead, we propose to use sketch as weak constraint, where the output edges do not necessarily follow the input edges. We address this problem using a novel joint image completion approach, where the sketch provides the image context for completing, or generating the output image. We train a generated adversarial network, i.e, contextual GAN to learn the joint distribution of sketch and the corresponding image by using joint images. Our contextual GAN has several advantages. First, the simple joint image representation allows for simple and effective learning of joint distribution in the same image-sketch space, which avoids complicated issues in cross-domain learning. Second, while the output is related to its input overall, the generated features exhibit more freedom in appearance and do not strictly align with the input features as previous conditional GANs do. Third, from the joint image’s point of view, image and sketch are of no difference, thus exactly the same deep joint image completion network can be used for image-to-sketch generation. Experiments evaluated on three different datasets show that our contextual GAN can generate more realistic images than state-of-the-art conditional GANs on challenging inputs and generalize well on common categories."

In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic learning-based framework to colorize sketches with proper color, texture as well as gradient. Our framework consists of two stages. In the first drafting stage, our model guesses color regions and splashes a rich variety of colors over the sketch to obtain a color draft. In the second refinement stage, it detects the unnatural colors and artifacts, and try to fix and refine the result. Comparing to existing approaches, this two-stage design effectively divides the complex colorization task into two simpler and goal-clearer subtasks. This eases the learning and raises the quality of colorization. Our model resolves the artifacts such as water-color blurring, color distortion, and dull textures.

A fundamental challenge for sketch analysis is to deal with drastically different human drawing styles, particularly in terms of abstraction level. In this work, we propose the first stroke-level sketch abstraction model based on the insight of sketch abstraction as a process of trading off between the recognizability of a sketch and the number of strokes used to draw it. Concretely, we train a model for abstract sketch generation through reinforcement learning of a stroke removal policy that learns to predict which strokes can be safely removed without affecting recognizability. We show that our abstraction model can be used for various sketch analysis tasks including: (1) modeling stroke saliency and understanding the decision of sketch recognition models, (2) synthesizing sketches of variable abstraction for a given category, or reference object instance in a photo, and (3) training a FG-SBIR model with photos only, bypassing the expensive photo-sketch pair collection step."

Lett.,2018,42,"Abstract We consider the image transformation problems in this paper, where an input face photo is transformed into a sketch, i.e. face sketch synthesis. It plays important role in video surveillance-based law enforcement. Recent methods for such problems typically train feed-forward convolutional neural networks (CNN) or graphical probabilistic models. In this paper, inspired by the recent success in generating images of generative adversarial networks (GAN), we employ GAN to perform this task. However, accompanying with fine textures generated by GAN model, noise appears among the generated results. We proposed a back projection method to reconstruct the synthesized results. Extensive experiments on public face databases illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods. The proposed back projection strategy can be extended to other GAN-based image-to-image translation problems.

However, SBIR remains a long-standing unsolved problem mainly because of the significant discrepancy between the sketch domain and the image domain. In this work, we propose a Generative Domain-migration Hashing (GDH) approach, which for the first time generates hashing codes from synthetic natural images that are migrated from sketches. The generative model learns a mapping that the distributions of sketches can be indistinguishable from the distribution of natural images using an adversarial loss, and simultaneously learns an inverse mapping based on the cycle consistency loss in order to enhance the indistinguishability. With the robust mapping learned from the generative model, GDH can migrate sketches to their indistinguishable image counterparts while preserving the domain-invariant information of sketches. With an end-to-end multi-task learning framework, the generative model and binarized hashing codes can be jointly optimized. Comprehensive experiments of both category-level and fine-grained SBIR on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate the consistently balanced superiority of GDH in terms of efficiency, memory costs and effectiveness (Models and code at https://github.com/YCJGG/GDH)."

Since many distributed ML algorithms trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) involve communicating gradients through the network, it is important to compress the transferred gradient. A category of low-precision algorithms can significantly reduce the size of gradients, at the expense of some precision loss. However, existing low-precision methods are not suitable for many cases where the gradients are sparse and nonuniformly distributed. In this paper, we study is there a compression method that can efficiently handle a sparse and nonuniform gradient consisting of key-value pairs? Our first contribution is a sketch based method that compresses the gradient values. Sketch is a class of algorithms using a probabilistic data structure to approximate the distribution of input data. We design a quantile-bucket quantification method that uses a quantile sketch to sort gradient values into buckets and encodes them with the bucket indexes. To further compress the bucket indexes, our second contribution is a sketch algorithm, namely MinMaxSketch. MinMaxSketch builds a set of hash tables and solves hash collisions with a MinMax strategy. The third contribution of this paper is a delta-binary encoding method that calculates the increment of the gradient keys and stores them with fewer bytes. We also theoretically discuss the correctness and the error bound of three proposed methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort combining data sketch with ML. We implement a prototype system in a real cluster of our industrial partner Tencent Inc., and show that our method is up to 10X faster than existing methods."

Recently, several Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based methods have achieved great success. They can generate colorized illustrations conditioned on given line art and color hints. However, these methods fail to capture the authentic illustration distributions and are hence perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they often lack accurate shading. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep conditional adversarial architecture for scribble based anime line art colorization. Specifically, we integrate the conditional framework with WGAN-GP criteria as well as the perceptual loss to enable us to robustly train a deep network that makes the synthesized images more natural and real. We also introduce a local features network that is independent of synthetic data. With GANs conditioned on features from such network, we notably increase the generalization capability over ""in the wild"" line arts. Furthermore, we collect two datasets that provide high-quality colorful illustrations and authentic line arts for training and benchmarking. With the proposed model trained on our illustration dataset, we demonstrate that images synthesized by the presented approach are considerably more realistic and precise than alternative approaches."

First, there is no large-scale annotated comics dataset. The CNN-based methods require large-scale annotations for training. Secondly, the objects in comics are highly overlapped compared to naturalistic images. This overlap causes the assignment problem in the existing CNN-based methods. To solve these problems, we proposed a new annotation dataset and a new CNN model. We annotated an existing image dataset of comics and created the largest annotation dataset, named Manga109-annotations. For the assignment problem, we proposed a new CNN-based detector, SSD300-fork. We compared SSD300-fork with other detection methods using Manga109-annotations and confirmed that our model outperformed them based on the mAP score."

Depending on the prestige of the task, publishing it can come along with a lot of visibility. The question arises how reliable are our evaluation methodologies to compare approaches? 
One common methodology to identify the state-of-the-art is to partition data into a train, a development and a test set. Researchers can train and tune their approach on some part of the dataset and then select the model that worked best on the development set for a final evaluation on unseen test data. Test scores from different approaches are compared, and performance differences are tested for statistical significance. 
In this publication, we show that there is a high risk that a statistical significance in this type of evaluation is not due to a superior learning approach. Instead, there is a high risk that the difference is due to chance. For example for the CoNLL 2003 NER dataset we observed in up to 26% of the cases type I errors (false positives) with a threshold of p < 0.05, i.e., falsely concluding a statistically significant difference between two identical approaches.

In spite of their high clustering accuracy, SC methods incur prohibitively high computational complexity when processing large volumes of high-dimensional data. Inspired by random sketching approaches for dimensionality reduction, the present paper introduces a randomized scheme for SC, termed Sketch-SC, tailored for large volumes of high-dimensional data. Sketch-SC accelerates the computationally heavy parts of state-of-the-art SC approaches by compressing the data matrix across both dimensions using random projections, thus enabling fast and accurate large-scale SC.

Subsequently, we explicitly introduce a cross-modality transformation network to compensate for the divergence between two modalities, which can transfer features of 2D sketches to the feature space of 3D shapes. We develop an adversarial learning based method to train the transformation model, by simultaneously enhancing the holistic correlations between data distributions of two modalities, and mitigating the local semantic divergences through minimizing a cross-modality mean discrepancy term. Experimental results on the SHREC 2013 and SHREC 2014 datasets clearly show the superior retrieval performance of our proposed model, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches."

The model-based approach is quite straightforward but nontrivial, since people could not always have the desired 3D query model available by side. Recently, large amounts of wide-screen electronic devices are prevail in our daily lives, which makes the sketch-based 3D shape retrieval a promising candidate due to its simpleness and efficiency. The main challenge of sketch-based approach is the huge modality gap between sketch and 3D shape. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep correlated holistic metric learning (DCHML) method to mitigate the discrepancy between sketch and 3D shape domains. The proposed DCHML trains two distinct deep neural networks (one for each domain) jointly, which learns two deep nonlinear transformations to map features from both domains into a new feature space. The proposed loss, including discriminative loss and correlation loss, aims to increase the discrimination of features within each domain as well as the correlation between different domains. In the new feature space, the discriminative loss minimizes the intra-class distance of the deep transformed features and maximizes the inter-class distance of the deep transformed features to a large margin within each domain, while the correlation loss focused on mitigating the distribution discrepancy across different domains. Different from existing deep metric learning methods only with loss at the output layer, our proposed DCHML is trained with loss at both hidden layer and output layer to further improve the performance by encouraging features in the hidden layer also with desired properties. Our proposed method is evaluated on three benchmarks, including 3D Shape Retrieval Contest 2013, 2014, and 2016 benchmarks, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods."

The core of our approach is a sharp-interface finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) wavesolver, with a series of supporting algorithms to handle rapidly deforming and vibrating embedded interfaces arising in physics-based animation sound. Once the solver rasterizes these interfaces, it must evaluate acceleration boundary conditions (BCs) that involve model-and phenomena-specific computations. We introduce acoustic shaders as a mechanism to abstract away these complexities, and describe a variety of implementations for computer animation: near-rigid objects with ringing and acceleration noise, deformable (finite element) models such as thin shells, bubble-based water, and virtual characters. Since time-domain wave synthesis is expensive, we only simulate pressure waves in a small region about each sound source, then estimate a far-field pressure signal. To further improve scalability beyond multi-threading, we propose a fully time-parallel sound synthesis method that is demonstrated on commodity cloud computing resources.

However, not all of these vector images are equally useful to the user, especially if performing further edits is desired. We therefore define the problem of computing an instance segmentation of the most likely set of paths that could have created the raster image. Once the segmentation is computed, we use existing vectorization approaches to vectorize each path, and then combine all paths into the final output vector image. To determine which set of paths is most likely, we train a pair of neural networks to provide semantic clues that help resolve ambiguities at intersection and overlap regions. These predictions are made considering the full context of the image, and are then globally combined by solving a Markov Random Field (MRF). We demonstrate the flexibility of our method by generating results on character datasets, a synthetic random line dataset, and a dataset composed of human drawn sketches.

Considering composite sketch is generated from facial components, a component-based representation approach (CBR) was proposed to match composite sketch to photos recently. They extract multi-scale local binary pattern (MLBP) feature from every component and use the fusion of four most discriminative components as the final matching score, ignoring the inherent structure of composite sketch and the fusion does not take the full components’ information into consideration. This paper presents a novel composite sketch recognition method by extracting scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) feature and histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature from components, fusing different features at score level, combining facial components with linear function. In our proposed method, feature fusion could extract local texture and structure feature from composite sketches. The linear combination not only reserves complete component information but also protrudes different components contribution to the holistic face image.

These objects provide natural haptic feedback whenever the pen touches them, and, unlike in VR, there is no need to digitize the physical object first. Especially in Personal Fabrication, this lets non-professional designers quickly create simple 3D models that fit existing physical objects. We studied how accurately visual lines and concave/convex surfaces let users draw 3D shapes attached to physical vs. virtual objects in AR. Results show that tracing physical objects is 48% more accurate, but takes longer than tracing virtual objects. Concave physical edges further improve accuracy due to their haptic guidance. Our findings provide initial metrics when designing AR sketching systems."

Existing sketch-photo recognition approaches have mostly ignored the importance of facial attributes. In this paper, we propose a new loss function, called attribute-centered loss, to train a Deep Coupled Convolutional Neural Network (DCCNN) for facial attribute guided sketch to photo matching. Specifically, an attribute-centered loss is proposed which learns several distinct centers, in a shared embedding space, for photos and sketches with different combinations of attributes. The DCCNN simultaneously is trained to map photos and pairs of testified attributes and corresponding forensic sketches around their associated centers, while preserving the spatial topology information. Importantly, the centers learn to keep a relative distance from each other, related to their number of contradictory attributes. Extensive experiments are performed on composite (E-PRIP) and semi-forensic (IIIT-D Semi-forensic) databases. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art."

The key issue lies in the difficulty to use data under fixed conditions to train a model against imaging variations. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network termed pGAN, which can generate face sketches efficiently using training data under fixed conditions and handle the aforementioned uncontrolled conditions. In pGAN, we embed key photo priors into the process of synthesis and design a parametric sigmoid activation function for compensating illumination variations. Compared to the existing methods, we quantitatively demonstrate that the proposed method can work well on face photos in the wild."

However, the limited number of paired sketch-photo training data usually prevents the current frameworks to learn a robust mapping between the geometry of sketches and their matching photo-realistic images. Consequently, in this work, we present an approach for learning to synthesize a photo-realistic image from a face sketch in an unsupervised fashion. In contrast to current unsupervised image-to-image translation techniques, our framework leverages a novel perceptual discriminator to learn the geometry of human face. Learning racial prior information empowers the network to remove the geometrical artifacts in the face sketch. We demonstrate that a simultaneous optimization of the face photo generator network, employing the proposed perceptual discriminator in combination with a texture-wise discriminator, results in a significant improvement in quality and recognition rate of the synthesized photos. We evaluate the proposed network by conducting extensive experiments on multiple baseline sketch-photo datasets."

This paper argues that such research has overlooked an important and useful intrinsic motivator: social interaction. We posit that making an AI agent aware of implicit social feedback from humans can allow for faster learning of more generalizable and useful representations, and could potentially impact AI safety. We collect social feedback in the form of facial expression reactions to samples from Sketch RNN, an LSTM-based variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to produce sketch drawings. We use a Latent Constraints GAN (LC-GAN) to learn from the facial feedback of a small group of viewers, and then show in an independent evaluation with 76 users that this model produced sketches that lead to significantly more positive facial expressions. Thus, we establish that implicit social feedback can improve the output of a deep learning model."

However, one is not always guaranteed to have such a photo readily available under a practical forensic setting. In this paper, we define the problem of Sketch Re-ID, which instead of using a photo as input, it initiates the query process using a professional sketch of the target person. This is akin to the traditional problem of forensic facial sketch recognition, yet with the major difference that our sketches are whole-body other than just the face. This problem is challenging because sketches and photos are in two distinct domains. Specifically, a sketch is the abstract description of a person. Besides, person appearance in photos is variational due to camera viewpoint, human pose and occlusion. We address the Sketch Re-ID problem by proposing a cross-domain adversarial feature learning approach to jointly learn the identity features and domain-invariant features. We employ adversarial feature learning to filter low-level interfering features and remain high-level semantic information. We also contribute to the community the first Sketch Re-ID dataset with 200 persons, where each person has one sketch and two photos from different cameras associated. Extensive experiments have been performed on the proposed dataset and other common sketch datasets including CUFSF and QUML-shoe. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts."

Birth-collision free paths are treated identically to collision–collision free paths and application of this to general, bounded scenes with inclusions leads to nonreciprocal transport. Beginning with reciprocity as a desired property, we propose a new way to integrate nonexponential transport theory into general scenes. We distinguish between the free-path-length statistics between correlated medium particles and the free-path-length statistics beginning at locations not correlated to medium particles, such as boundary surfaces, inclusions, and uncorrelated sources. Reciprocity requires that the uncorrelated free-path distributions are simply the normalized transmittance of the correlated free-path distributions. The combination leads to an equilibrium imbedding of a previously derived generalized transport equation into bounded domains. We compare predictions of this approach to Monte Carlo simulation of multiple scattering from negatively correlated suspensions of monodispersive hard spheres in bounded two-dimensional domains and demonstrate improved performance relative to previous work. We also derive new, exact, reciprocal, single-scattering solutions for plane-parallel half-spaces over a variety of nonexponential media types."

As opposed to traditional sketch retrieval, our queries are drawn directly onto an example model. Using immersive virtual reality the user can express their query through a sketch that demonstrates the desired structure, color and texture. Unlike previous sketch-based retrieval methods, users remain immersed within the environment without relying on textual queries or 2D projections which can disconnect the user from the environment. We perform a test using queries over several descriptors, evaluating the precision in order to select the most accurate one. We show how a convolutional neural network (CNN) can create multi-view representations of colored 3D sketches. Using such a descriptor representation, our system is able to rapidly retrieve models and in this way, we provide the user with an interactive method of navigating large object datasets. Through a user study we demonstrate that by using our VR 3D model retrieval system, users can perform search more quickly and intuitively than with a naive linear browsing method. Using our system users can rapidly populate a virtual environment with specific models from a very large database, and thus the technique has the potential to be broadly applicable in immersive editing systems."

However training effective photo classifiers typically takes numerous examples which limits image recognition's scalability and applicability to scenarios where images may not be available. This has motivated investigation into zero-shot learning, which addresses the issue via knowledge transfer from other modalities such as text. In this paper we investigate an alternative approach of synthesizing image classifiers: almost directly from a user's imagination, via freehand sketch. This approach doesn't require the category to be nameable or describable via attributes as per zero-shot learning. We achieve this via training a model regression network to map from free-hand sketch space to the space of photo classifiers. It turns out that this mapping can be learned in a category-agnostic way, allowing photo classifiers for new categories to be synthesized by user with no need for annotated training photos. We also demonstrate that this modality of classifier generation can also be used to enhance the granularity of an existing photo classifier, or as a complement to name-based zero-shot learning."

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning architecture which extends face sketch synthesis to handle face photos in the wild by exploiting additional face photos in training. Instead of supervising the network with ground truth sketches, we first perform patch matching in feature space between the input photo and photos in a small reference set of photo-sketch pairs. We then compose a pseudo sketch feature representation using the corresponding sketch feature patches to supervise our network. With the proposed approach, we can train our networks using a small reference set of photo-sketch pairs together with a large face photo dataset without ground truth sketches.

However, this approach usually scales quadratically with the dimension; to cope with high-dimensional datasets, we show how to use fast structured random matrices to compute the sketching operator efficiently. This yields significant speed-ups and memory savings for high-dimensional data, while the clustering results are shown to be much more stable, both on artificial and real datasets."

However, the limited availability of labeled 2D hand-drawn sketches data (i.e. sketches and its corresponding 3D ground truth models) hinders the training process of supervised methods. In this paper, driven by a novel design of combination of retrieval and reconstruction process, we developed a learning paradigm to reconstruct 3D objects from hand-drawn sketches, without the use of well-labeled hand-drawn sketch data during the entire training process. Specifically, the paradigm begins with the training of an adaption network via autoencoder with adversarial loss, embedding the unpaired 2D rendered image domain with the hand-drawn sketch domain to a shared latent vector space. Then from the embedding latent space, for each testing sketch image, we retrieve a few (e.g. five) nearest neighbors from the training 3D data set as prior knowledge for a 3D Generative Adversarial Network.

However, cross-domain representation learning methods are typically cast into non-convex minimization problems that are difficult to optimize, leading to unsatisfactory performance. Inspired by self-paced learning (SPL), a learning methodology designed to overcome convergence issues related to local optima by exploiting the samples in a meaningful order (i.e., easy to hard), we introduce the cross-paced partial curriculum learning (CPPCL) framework. Compared with existing SPL methods which only consider a single modality and cannot deal with prior knowledge, CPPCL is specifically designed to assess the learning pace by jointly handling data from dual sources and modality-specific prior information provided in the form of partial curricula. In addition, thanks to the learned dictionaries, we demonstrate that the proposed CPPCL embeds robust coupled representations for SBIR.

Similarly, performance on multi-disciplinary tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) is considered a marker for gauging progress in Computer Vision. In our work, we bring games and VQA together. Specifically, we introduce the first computational model aimed at Pictionary, the popular word-guessing social game. We first introduce Sketch-QA, an elementary version of Visual Question Answering task. Styled after Pictionary, Sketch-QA uses incrementally accumulated sketch stroke sequences as visual data. Notably, Sketch-QA involves asking a fixed question (""What object is being drawn?"") and gathering open-ended guess-words from human guessers. We analyze the resulting dataset and present many interesting findings therein. To mimic Pictionary-style guessing, we subsequently propose a deep neural model which generates guess-words in response to temporally evolving human-drawn sketches. Our model even makes human-like mistakes while guessing, thus amplifying the human mimicry factor. We evaluate our model on the large-scale guess-word dataset generated via Sketch-QA task and compare with various baselines. We also conduct a Visual Turing Test to obtain human impressions of the guess-words generated by humans and our model. Experimental results demonstrate the promise of our approach for Pictionary and similarly themed games."

Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) accomplish this feat by generating robust face representations that can be analysed in a multidimensional ‘face space’. We examined the organization of viewpoint, illumination, gender and identity in this space. We found that DCNNs create a highly organized face similarity structure in which identities and images coexist. Natural image variation is organized hierarchically, with face identity nested under gender, and illumination and viewpoint nested under identity. To examine identity, we caricatured faces and found that identification accuracy increased with the strength of identity information in a face, and caricature representations ‘resembled’ their veridical counterparts—mimicking human perception. DCNNs therefore offer a theoretical framework for reconciling decades of behavioural and neural results that emphasized either the image or the face in representations, without understanding how a neural code could seamlessly accommodate both.Human face recognition is robust to changes in viewpoint, illumination, facial expression and appearance. The authors investigated face recognition in deep convolutional neural networks by manipulating the strength of identity information in a face by caricaturing. They found that networks create a highly organized face similarity structure in which identities and images coexist."

Face sketches have the essential information about the spatial topology and geometric details of faces while missing some important facial attributes such as ethnicity, hair, eye, and skin color. We propose a coupled deep neural network architecture which utilizes facial attributes in order to improve the sketch-photo recognition performance. The proposed Attribute-Assisted Deep Convolutional Neural Network (AADCNN) method exploits the facial attributes and leverages the loss functions from the facial attributes identification and face verification tasks in order to learn rich discriminative features in a common embedding subspace. The facial attribute identification task increases the inter-personal variations by pushing apart the embedded features extracted from individuals with different facial attributes, while the verification task reduces the intra-personal variations by pulling together all the features that are related to one person. The learned discriminative features can be well generalized to new identities not seen in the training data. The proposed architecture is able to make full use of the sketch and complementary facial attribute information to train a deep model compared to the conventional sketch-photo recognition methods. Extensive experiments are performed on composite (E-PRIP) and semi-forensic (IIIT-D semi-forensic) datasets. The results show the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-art models in sketch-photo recognition algorithms."

In this paper, we propose an improved topology extraction approach based on artists’ sketching customs.

We demonstrate that our improved topology benefits our vectorization method as well as existing topology-driven ones and allows them to vectorize rough sketchy line drawings robustly and efficiently."

Only one existing method is based on deep learning and achieves better experimental results, but its architecture is redundant and its time efficiency is not good. To address these problems, we propose an end-to-end, two-stage quadrilateral regressing network architecture for comic panel detection, which inherits the architecture of Faster R-CNN. At the first stage, we propose a quadrilateral region proposal network for generating panel proposals, based on a newly proposed quadrilateral regression method. At the second stage, we classify the proposals and refine their shapes with the proposed quadrilateral regression method again.

Synthesizing realistic 3D mesh animation sequences is a challenging and important task in computer animation. To achieve this, researchers have long been focusing on shape analysis to develop new interpolation and extrapolation techniques. However, such techniques have limited learning capabilities and therefore can produce unrealistic animation. Deep architectures that operate directly on mesh sequences remain unexplored, due to the following major barriers: meshes with irregular triangles, sequences containing rich temporal information and flexible deformations. To address these, we utilize convolutional neural networks defined on triangular meshes along with a shape deformation representation to extract useful features, followed by LSTM cells that iteratively process the features. To allow completion of a missing mesh sequence from given endpoints, we propose a new weight-shared bidirectional structure. The bidirectional generation loss also helps mitigate error accumulation over iterations. Benefiting from all these technical advances, our approach outperforms existing methods in sequence prediction and completion both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, this network can also generate follow-up frames conditioned on initial shapes and improve the accuracy as more bootstrap models are provided, which other works in the geometry processing domain cannot achieve."

Unlike previous sketch-based retrieval methods, users remain immersed within the environment without relying on textual queries or 2D projections which can disconnect the user from the environment. We show how a convolutional neural network (CNN) can create multi-view representations of colored 3D sketches. Using such a descriptor representation, our system is able to rapidly retrieve models and in this way, we provide the user with an interactive method of navigating large object datasets.

The global layer contains a set of search operations from particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to perform the task of global search. However, the control layer is responsible about controlling the execution of the implemented search operations at run time. Finally, the fine-tuning layer is aimed at performing search refinement to enhance the search ability. For sketch recognition, the proposed hybrid model is applied on the input face sketch to locate the internal sketch facial components. Three types of texture features extraction techniques are adopted in this study including Histogram Of Gradient (HOG), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Gabor wavelet. To assess the performances of the proposed model, a total of three face sketch databases have been used which are LFW, AR, and CUHK.

In this paper, we look at the challenging problem of cross modal face verification and recognition between caricature and visual image modalities. Caricature have exaggerations of facial features of a person. Due to the significant variations in the caricatures, building vision models for recognizing and verifying data from this modality is an extremely challenging task. Visual images with significantly lesser amount of distortions can act as a bridge for the analysis of caricature modality. We introduce a publicly available large Caricature-VIsual dataset [CaVI] with images from both the modalities that captures the rich variations in the caricature of an identity. This paper presents the first cross modal architecture that handles extreme distortions of caricatures using a deep learning network that learns similar representations across the modalities. We use two convolutional networks along with transformations that are subjected to orthogonality constraints to capture the shared and modality specific representations. In contrast to prior research, our approach neither depends on manually extracted facial landmarks for learning the representations, nor on the identities of the person for performing verification. The learned shared representation achieves 91% accuracy for verifying unseen images and 75% accuracy on unseen identities. Further, recognizing the identity in the image by knowledge transfer using a combination of shared and modality specific representations, resulted in an unprecedented performance of 85% rank-1 accuracy for caricatures and 95% rank-1 accuracy for visual images."

Secondly a multi-view attention network is designed to fuse the feature maps and forms a more accurate 3D shape representation. Meanwhile we use a CNN to extract the feature of sketches. Thirdly the similarity between sketches and 3D shapes is estimated via a generalized similarity model, which fuses some traditional similarity model into a generalized form and optimizes its parameters using a data-driven method.

We collect social feedback in the form of facial expression reactions to samples from Sketch RNN, an LSTM-based variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to produce sketch drawings. We use a Latent Constraints GAN (LC-GAN) to learn from the facial feedback of a small group of viewers, by optimizing the model to produce sketches that it predicts will lead to more positive facial expressions. We show in multiple independent evaluations that the model trained with facial feedback produced sketches that are more highly rated, and induce significantly more positive facial expressions. Thus, we establish that implicit social feedback can improve the output of a deep learning model."

Strongly connected to Azema-Yor/generalized draw-down/trailing stop time this framework provides a natural unification of draw-down and classic first passage times. We illustrate here the potential of this unified framework by solving a variation of the De Finetti problem of maximizing expected discounted cumulative dividends/consumption gained under a barrier policy, until an optimally chosen Azema-Yor time, with a general spectrally negative Markov model. While previously studied cases of this problem assumed either Lévy or diffusion models, and the draw-down function to be fixed, we describe, for a general spectrally negative Markov model, not only the optimal barrier but also the optimal draw-down function. This is achieved by solving a variational problem tackled by Pontryaghin's maximum principle. As a by-product we show that in the Lévy case the classic first passage solution is indeed optimal; in the diffusion case, we obtain the optimality equations, but the behavior of associated solutions for further explicit models and the question of whether they do better than the classic solution is left for future work. Instead, we illustrate the novelty by a toy example, with a conveniently chosen scale-like function."

Prior sketch based image retrieval (SBIR) algorithms adopt either a category-level or fine-grain (instance-level) definition of cross-domain similarity—returning images that match the sketched object class (category-level SBIR), or a specific instance of that object (fine-grain SBIR). In this paper we take the middle-ground; proposing an SBIR algorithm that returns images sharing both the object category and key visual characteristics of the sketched query without assuming photo-approximate sketches from the user. We describe a deeply learned cross-domain embedding in which ‘mid-grain’ sketch-image similarity may be measured, reporting on the efficacy of unsupervised and semi-supervised manifold alignment techniques to encourage better intra-category (mid-grain) discrimination within that embedding. We propose a new mid-grain sketch-image dataset (MidGrain65c) and demonstrate not only mid-grain discrimination, but also improved category-level discrimination using our approach."

In this paper, we first propose a new freehand sketch generation model (FHS-GAN), which is based on the deep architecture of dual generative adversarial nets (GANs). We construct a model which utilize the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and GAN to produce freehand sketches. We then propose an improved deep CNN model as a validated network, which is based on Faster R-CNN, to measure the similarity of real sketches and generated freehand sketches by FHS-GAN, and we test the improved model using the produced sketches with two large sketch datasets. The experiments show that the proposed FHS-GAN framework achieves state-of-the-art results in comparison with other baseline models. Furthermore, the generated sketches can be used for other sketch recognition tasks, such as in a pre-processing step for application in sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) and fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR). Overall, our FHS-GAN model is important for the development of freehand sketches."

Sketches are clearly related to photo edge-maps, but a human free-hand sketch of a photo is not simply a clean rendering of that photo’s edge map. Instead there is a fundamental process of abstraction and iconic rendering, where overall geometry is warped and salient details are selectively included. In this paper we study this sketching process and attempt to invert it. We model this inversion by translating iconic free-hand sketches to contours that resemble more geometrically realistic projections of object boundaries, and separately factorise out the salient added details. This factorised re-representation makes it easier to match a free-hand sketch to a photo instance of an object. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised image style transfer model based on enforcing a cyclic embedding consistency constraint. A deep FG-SBIR model is then formulated to accommodate complementary discriminative detail from each factorised sketch for better matching with the corresponding photo. Our method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively to demonstrate its superiority over a number of state-of-the-art alternatives for style transfer and FG-SBIR."

A common way of encoding ""style"" is through a feature representation based on the Gram matrix of features extracted by some pre-trained neural network or some other form of feature statistics. Such a definition is based on an arbitrary human decision and may not best capture what a style really is. In trying to gain a better understanding of ""style"", we propose a metric learning-based method to explicitly encode the style of an artwork. In particular, our definition of style captures the differences between artists, as shown by classification performances, and such that the style representation can be interpreted, manipulated and visualized through style-conditioned image generation through a Generative Adversarial Network. We employ this method to explore the style space of anime portrait illustrations."

Here, clustering refers to the problem of partitioning some input metric measure space (mm-space) into $k$ clusters, minimizing some objective function $f$. Sketching, on the other hand, is the problem of approximating some mm-space by a smaller one supported on a set of $k$ points. Specifically, we define the $k$-sketch of some mm-space $M$ to be the nearest neighbor of $M$ in the set of $k$-point mm-spaces, under some distance function $\rho$ on the set of mm-spaces. 
In this paper, we demonstrate a duality between general classes of clustering and sketching problems. We present a general method for efficiently transforming a solution for a clustering problem to a solution for a sketching problem, and vice versa, with approximately equal cost. More specifically, we obtain the following results. We define the sketching/clustering gap to be the supremum over all mm-spaces of the ratio of the sketching and clustering objectives. 
1. For metric spaces, we consider the case where $f$ is the maximum cluster diameter, and $\rho$ is the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. We show that the gap is constant for any compact metric space. 
2. We extend the above results to obtain constant gaps for the case of mm-spaces, where $\rho$ is the $p$-Gromov-Wasserstein distance and the clustering objective involves minimizing various notions of the $\ell_p$-diameters of the clusters. 
3. We consider two competing notions of sketching for mm-spaces, with one of them being more demanding than the other. These notions arise from two different definitions of $p$-Gromov-Wasserstein distance that have appeared in the literature. We then prove that whereas the gap between these can be arbitrarily large, in the case of doubling metric spaces the resulting sketching objectives are polynomially related."

In order to produce convincing faces with intact facial parts, we exploit global and local discriminators to capture global facial features and three local facial regions, respectively. Moreover, we use a specific content network to capture and preserve face characteristic and identity between cartoons and photos. As a result, the proposed approach can generate convincing high-quality faces that satisfy both the characteristic and identity constraints of input cartoon faces. Compared with recent works on unpaired image-to-image translation, our proposed method is able to generate more realistic and correlative images."

However, naive binarization results in accuracy drops when applied to networks for most tasks. In this work, we present a highly generalized, distribution-aware approach to binarizing deep networks that allows us to retain the advantages of a binarized network, while reducing accuracy drops. We also develop efficient implementations for our proposed approach across different architectures. We present a theoretical analysis of the technique to show the effective representational power of the resulting layers, and explore the forms of data they model best.

Cartoons have become one of the most important source of entertainment, but it also introduce a lot of ideas that are not suitable for them. Violence is one of the unwanted feature that is prevalent in cartoons to put element of fantasy and enchantment. In order to stop children from viewing violent intense cartoons, the best strategy is to make them inaccessible. Therefore, some sort of filters should be placed at certain hubs to perform this task. The challenge is that how a filter will know that a particular cartoon video has violent content in it. The meta-data telling the world about the video does not inform that the video consists of violent material. Certain frames/snapshots/images of video, if analyzed using image processing techniques, can help in concluding that a particular video has intense material in it. The aim of this work is to classify social media videos especially related to animated cartoons with violent / nonviolent behaviors. It addresses the problem of content based image matching algorithms based on key point descriptors. The basic goal is to extract general information from an image without any specific query. First SIFT-descriptors are extracted from a large set of images. This set of descriptors are then defined as a means of providing fast and accurate comparisons between images and distinguish between violent and nonviolent images in combination with Machine Learning algorithms. The results are then compared for each classifier with varying parameters."

This method is fast and easily automated, making it particularly beneficial in an era where IFU and interferometric surveys are yielding samples of thousands of galaxies. We demonstrate the Radon transform by applying it to gas and stellar velocity fields from the first ~2800 galaxies of the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. We separately classify gas and stellar velocity fields into five categories based on the shape of their radial PA_k profiles. At least half of stellar velocity fields and two-thirds of gas velocity fields are found to show detectable deviations from uniform coplanar circular motion, although most of these variations are symmetric about the center of the galaxy. The behavior of gas and stellar velocity fields is largely independent, even when PA_k profiles for both components are measured over the same radii. We present evidence that one class of symmetric PA_k variations is likely associated with bars and/or oval distortions, while another class is more consistent with warped disks. This analysis sets the stage for more in-depth future studies which explore the origin of diverse kinematic behavior in the galaxy population."

A Pilot Study on Verbal and Sketched Object Descriptions,,2018,1,"Previous work on multimodality in interaction has mostly focussed on integrating models for verbal utterances and embodied modalities like gestures. In this paper, we take a first step towards investigating multimodal interaction that combines verbal utterances and hand-drawn sketches which can be essential, for instance, for conveying explanation in dialogue. While there is a lot of theoretical work on how drawing and sketching convey iconic meaning, there is no realistic data set that pairs language and sketch as integrated modalities. Recently, the Draw-and-Tell corpus enriched a pre-existing dataset (the “Sketchy Dataset”) with verbal descriptions of the sketched images. We base our study on this corpus and implement two models that learn to generate simple verbal and sketched object descriptions in a parallel fashion. We evaluated our models in unimodal and multimodal object identification tasks with human listeners via crowd-sourcing experiments. The results show that partial hand-drawn sketches clearly improve the effectiveness of verbal descriptions, even if the generator did not coordinate their meanings. Interestingly, we also find that unimodal sketched object descriptions outperform multimodal descriptions. We argue that this highlights the great potential of sketched explanations for multimodal interaction, but at the same time, shows the need for more natural data sets that provide insights into the orchestration of verbal and sketched elements in multimodal descriptions."

With the growing number of EHR implementations, such knowledge is increasingly challenging to obtain in an efficient manner. We address this challenge by proposing a novel methodology to analyze large sets of EHRs using a modified Count Sketch data streaming algorithm termed DreamNLP. By using DreamNLP, we generate a dictionary of frequently occurring terms or heavy hitters in the EHRs using low computational memory compared to conventional counting approach other NLP programs use. We demonstrate the extraction of the most important breast diagnosis features from the EHRs in a set of patients that underwent breast imaging. Based on the analysis, extraction of these terms would be useful for defining important features for downstream tasks such as machine learning for precision medicine."

However, these methods are of limited utility because it is difficult for a user to control what the network produces. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial image synthesis architecture that is conditioned on sketched boundaries and sparse color strokes to generate realistic cars, bedrooms, or faces. We demonstrate a sketch based image synthesis system which allows users to scribble over the sketch to indicate preferred color for objects. Our network can then generate convincing images that satisfy both the color and the sketch constraints of user. The network is feed-forward which allows users to see the effect of their edits in real time. We compare to recent work on sketch to image synthesis and show that our approach generates more realistic, diverse, and controllable outputs. The architecture is also effective at user-guided colorization of grayscale images."

Sketches annotate tasks with sequences of named subtasks, providing information about high-level structural relationships among tasks but not how to implement them—specifically not providing the detailed guidance used by much previous work on learning policy abstractions for RL (e.g. intermediate rewards, subtask completion signals, or intrinsic motivations). To learn from sketches, we present a model that associates every subtask with a modular subpolicy, and jointly maximizes reward over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across shared subpolicies. Optimization is accomplished via a decoupled actor-critic training objective that facilitates learning common behaviors from multiple dissimilar reward functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in three environments featuring both discrete and continuous control, and with sparse rewards that can be obtained only after completing a number of high-level sub-goals. Experiments show that using our approach to learn policies guided by sketches gives better performance than existing techniques for learning task-specific or shared policies, while naturally inducing a library of interpretable primitive behaviors that can be recombined to rapidly adapt to new tasks."

Work in this area mainly focuses on extracting representative and shared features for sketches and natural images. However, these can neither cope well with the geometric distortion between sketches and images nor be feasible for large-scale SBIR due to the heavy continuous-valued distance computation. In this paper, we speed up SBIR by introducing a novel binary coding method, named Deep Sketch Hashing (DSH), where a semi-heterogeneous deep architecture is proposed and incorporated into an end-to-end binary coding framework. Specifically, three convolutional neural networks are utilized to encode free-hand sketches, natural images and, especially, the auxiliary sketch-tokens which are adopted as bridges to mitigate the sketch-image geometric distortion. The learned DSH codes can effectively capture the cross-view similarities as well as the intrinsic semantic correlations between different categories. To the best of our knowledge, DSH is the first hashing work specifically designed for category-level SBIR with an end-to-end deep architecture. The proposed DSH is comprehensively evaluated on two large-scale datasets of TU-Berlin Extension and Sketchy, and the experiments consistently show DSHs superior SBIR accuracies over several state-of-the-art methods, while achieving significantly reduced retrieval time and memory footprint."

Fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) importantly leverages on such fine-grained characteristics of sketches to conduct instance-level retrieval of photos.

Existing FG-SBIR approaches focus only on coarse holistic matching via deep cross-domain representation learning, yet ignore explicitly accounting for fine-grained details and their spatial context. In this paper, a novel deep FG-SBIR model is proposed which differs significantly from the existing models in that: (1) It is spatially aware, achieved by introducing an attention module that is sensitive to the spatial position of visual details: (2) It combines coarse and fine semantic information via a shortcut connection fusion block: and (3) It models feature correlation and is robust to misalignments between the extracted features across the two domains by introducing a novel higher-order learnable energy function (HOLEF) based loss.

In this paper, we introduce network sketching as a novel technique of pursuing binary-weight CNNs, targeting at more faithful inference and better trade-off for practical applications. Our basic idea is to exploit binary structure directly in pre-trained filter banks and to produce binary-weight models via tensor expansion. The whole process can be treated as a coarse-to-fine model approximation, akin to the pencil drawing steps of outlining and shading. To further speedup the generated models, namely the sketches, we also propose an associative implementation of binary tensor convolutions.

Given an approximate and abstract hand-drawn 2D sketch provided by a user, our algorithm automatically computes a set of procedural model parameters, which in turn yield multiple, detailed output shapes that resemble the user's input sketch. The user can then select an output shape, or further modify the sketch to explore alternative ones.

During synthesis, we infer a posterior distribution over sketches, then concretize samples from this distribution into type-safe programs using combinatorial techniques. Second, our statistical model explicitly models the full intent behind a synthesis task as a latent variable. To infer sketches, we first estimate a posterior distribution on the intent, then use samples from this posterior to generate a distribution over possible sketches. We show that our model can be implemented effectively using the new neural architecture of Bayesian encoder-decoders, which can be trained with stochastic gradient descent and yields a simple inference procedure. We implement our ideas in a system, called BAYOU, for the synthesis of API-heavy Java methods. We train BAYOU on a large corpus of Android apps, and find that the trained system can often synthesize complex methods given just a few API method names or data types as evidence. The experiments also justify the design choice of using a latent intent variable and the levels of abstraction at which sketches and evidence are defined."

In this paper, we propose to learn barycenters of 2D projections of 3D shapes for sketch-based 3D shape retrieval. Specifically, we first use two deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract deep features of sketches and 2D projections of 3D shapes. For 3D shapes, we then compute the Wasserstein barycenters of deep features of multiple projections to form a barycentric representation. Finally, by constructing a metric network, a discriminative loss is formulated on the Wasserstein barycenters of 3D shapes and sketches in the deep feature space to learn discriminative and compact 3D shape and sketch features for retrieval. The proposed method is evaluated on the SHREC13 and SHREC14 sketch track benchmark datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method can significantly improve the retrieval performance."

Existing methods are data-driven, which synthesize a sketch by linearly combining K candidate sketch patches which are purposely selected from the training data. However, these methods have large computation cost due to neighbor selection process that perform neighbor searching on a large scale of training image patches. Instead of the aforementioned commonly used data-driven strategy, we propose to learn some models from training photos to training sketches which could speed the synthesis process a lot while preserving comparable or even better synthesis performance. Specially, we learn some ridge regressors from training photo patch intensities to training sketch patch intensities. An initial estimation is obtained from these regressors. Simultaneously, a high-frequency image is hallucinated from some ridge regressors which are learned from the high-frequency information of training photos and sketches. The high-frequency image is superimposed to the initial estimation to compensate the filtered details due to the dense average in the initial estimation process. Extensive experiments on public face sketch database illustrate the effectiveness of proposed model-driven strategy."

Studies on sketch can be roughly summarized into recognition and generation. Existing models on image recognition failed to obtain satisfying performance on sketch classification. But for sketch generation, a recent study proposed a sequence-to-sequence variational-auto-encoder (VAE) model called sketch-rnn which was able to generate sketches based on human inputs. The model achieved amazing results when asked to learn one category of object, such as an animal or a vehicle. However, the performance dropped when multiple categories were fed into the model. Here, we proposed a model called sketch-pix2seq which could learn and draw multiple categories of sketches. Two modifications were made to improve the sketch-rnn model: one is to replace the bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) encoder with a convolutional neural network(CNN); the other is to remove the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the objective function of VAE. Experimental results showed that models with CNN encoders outperformed those with RNN encoders in generating human-style sketches. Visualization of the latent space illustrated that the removal of KL-divergence made the encoder learn a posterior of latent space that reflected the features of different categories. Moreover, the combination of CNN encoder and removal of KL-divergence, i.e., the sketch-pix2seq model, had better performance in learning and generating sketches of multiple categories and showed promising results in creativity tasks."

It is traditionally produced in black and white, and colorization is time consuming and costly. Automatic colorization methods generally rely on greyscale values, which are not present in manga. Furthermore, due to copyright protection, colorized manga available for training is scarce. We propose a manga colorization method based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN). Unlike previous cGAN approaches that use many hundreds or thousands of training images, our method requires only a single colorized reference image for training, avoiding the need of a large dataset. Colorizing manga using cGANs can produce blurry results with artifacts, and the resolution is limited. We therefore also propose a method of segmentation and color-correction to mitigate these issues. The final results are sharp, clear, and in high resolution, and stay true to the character's original color scheme."

Traditional modelbased search is usually not convenient, since people don’t always have 3D model available by side. The sketch-based 3D shape retrieval is a promising candidate due to its simpleness and efficiency. The main challenge for sketch-based 3D shape retrieval is the discrepancy across different domains. In the paper, we propose a novel deep correlated metric learning (DCML) method to mitigate the discrepancy between sketch and 3D shape domains. The proposed DCML trains two distinct deep neural networks (one for each domain) jointly with one loss, which learns two deep nonlinear transformations to map features from both domains into a nonlinear feature space. The proposed loss, including discriminative loss and correlation loss, aims to increase the discrimination of features within each domain as well as the correlation between different domains. In the transfered space, the discriminative loss minimizes the intra-class distance of the deep transformed features and maximizes the inter-class distance of the deep transformed features at least a predefined margin within each domain, while the correlation loss focuses on minimizing the distribution discrepancy across different domains.

Moreover, the generalization ability of current systems is somewhat limited since they usually require elaborately collecting a dictionary of examples or carefully tuning features/components. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning framework that generates an end-to-end photo-sketch mapping through structure and texture decomposition. In the training stage, we first decompose the input face photo into different components according to their representational contents (i.e., structural and textural parts) by using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, we utilize a branched fully CNN for learning structural and textural representations, respectively. In addition, we design a sorted matching mean square error metric to measure texture patterns in the loss function. In the stage of sketch rendering, our approach automatically generates structural and textural representations for the input photo and produces the final result via a probabilistic fusion scheme.

In this work, we extract a set of acoustic features from input audio, including Mel-scaled spectrogram, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and chromagram that can effectively represent both contextual progression and emotional intensity of the speech. Output facial movements are characterized by 3D rotation and blending expression weights of a blendshape model, which can be used directly for animation. Thus, even though our model does not explicitly predict the affective states of the target speaker, her emotional manifestation is recreated via expression weights of the face model.

However, these methods have two limitations: 1) they depend on many training photo–sketch pairs and 2) they cannot tackle nonfacial factors (e.g., hairpins, glasses, backgrounds, and image size) if these factors are excluded in training data.

By performing instance-level (rather than category-level) retrieval, it embodies a timely and practical application, particularly with the ubiquitous availability of touchscreens.

Recently, great progress has been made in face sketch synthesis. Most state-of-the-art FSS methods work at patch level.

Furthermore, the common used weighting combination in these methods leads to the lost of reasonable high frequency details. We argue that all these factors are necessary for face sketch synthesis. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective unified approach considering position constraint, global search and high frequency compensation to infer pseudosketches from input test photos. Firstly, a nearest-neighbor search is conducted by combining both position constraint and global search. After obtaining the candidate image patches, a Markov network is applied to generate the pseudosketch.

We consider these multiple drawings under sampling with or without replacement. For the class of affine conditional expected value, we study the number of white balls after $n$ steps. The affine class is parametrized by $\Lambda$, specified by the ratio of the two eigenvalues of a reduced ball replacement matrix and the sample size, leading to three different cases: small-index urns ($\Lambda \le \frac 1 2$, and the case $\Lambda= \frac 1 2$ is critical), large-index urns ($\Lambda > \frac 1 2$), and triangular urns. In Part I we derived a central limit theorem for small index urns, and proved almost-sure convergence for large index and triangular urn models. In the present paper (Part II), we continue the study of affiance urn schemes and study the moments of large-index urns and triangular urn models. We show moment convergence under suitable scaling and we also provide expressions for the moments."

In this paper, we propose a fast preprocessing method named Bidirectional Luminance Remapping (BLR), which interactively adjust the lighting of training and input photos. Our method can be directly integrated into state-of-the-art exemplar-based methods to improve their robustness with ignorable computational cost."

Depending on how the object is described by the user, two general approaches exist: sketch-based FGIR or text-based FGIR, each of which has its own pros and cons. However, no attempt has been made to systematically investigate how informative each of these two input modalities is, and more importantly whether they are complementary to each thus should be modelled jointly. In this work, for the first time we introduce a multi-modal FGIR dataset with both sketches and sentences description provided as query modalities. A multi-modal quadruplet deep network is formulated to jointly model the sketch and text input modalities as well as the photo output modality. We show that on its own the sketch modality is much more informative than text and each modality can benefit the other when they are modelled jointly."

Specifically, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is employed to enrich the content information of sketches and recover the imaginary images, and two VGG-based encoders, which work on real and imaginary images respectively, are used to constrain their perceptual consistency from the view of feature representations. During SBIR, we first generate an imaginary image from a given sketch via cGAN, and then take the output of the learned encoder for imaginary images as the feature of the query sketch.

Thus, our method can find the gaps in line drawings and complete them without user interaction. Furthermore, the completion realistically conserves thickness and curvature of the line segments. All the necessary heuristics for such realistic line completion are learned naturally from a dataset of line drawings, where various patterns of line completion are generated on the fly as training pairs to improve the model generalization. We evaluate our method qualitatively on a diverse set of challenging line drawings and also provide quantitative results with a user study, where it significantly outperforms the state of the art."

Our deep neural network directly maps an input sequence of speech audio to a series of micro facial action unit activations and head rotations to drive a 3D blendshape face model. In particular, our deep model is able to learn the latent representations of time-varying contextual information and affective states within the speech. Hence, our model not only activates appropriate facial action units at inference to depict different utterance generating actions, in the form of lip movements, but also, without any assumption, automatically estimates emotional intensity of the speaker and reproduces her ever-changing affective states by adjusting strength of facial unit activations. For example, in a happy speech, the mouth opens wider than normal, while other facial units are relaxed; or in a surprised state, both eyebrows raise higher. Experiments on a diverse audiovisual corpus of different actors across a wide range of emotional states show interesting and promising results of our approach. Being speaker-independent, our generalized model is readily applicable to various tasks in human-machine interaction and animation."

Relevant issues to address in this context include the sheer volume of data that may consist of categorical observations, the typically streaming  format of acquisition, and the possibly missing entries. To cope with these challenges, this paper develops a novel categorical subspace learning approach to unravel the latent structure for three prominent categorical (bilinear) models, namely, Probit, Tobit, and Logit. The deterministic Probit and Tobit models treat data as quantized values of an analog-valued process lying in a low-dimensional subspace, while the probabilistic Logit model relies on low dimensionality of the data log-likelihood ratios. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of the sought models, a rank regularized maximum-likelihood estimator is devised, which is then solved recursively via alternating majorization-minimization to sketch high-dimensional categorical data “on the fly.” The resultant lightweight first-order algorithms entail highly parallelizable tasks per iteration. In addition, the quantization thresholds are also learned jointly with the subspace to enhance the predictive power of the sought models. Performance of the subspace iterates is analyzed for both infinite and finite data streams, where for the former asymptotic convergence to the stationary point set of the batch estimator is established, while for the latter sublinear regret bounds are derived for the empirical cost. Simulated tests with both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the merits of the novel schemes for real-time movie recommendation and chess-game classification."

With 16 galaxies we can extend this analysis out to about 9 kpc, i.e. a distance of ∼ 2 Re, vertically from the midplane. In the halo, the surface brightnesses of the [O ii] and Hα emission lines are comparable, unlike in the disk where Hα dominates. When we split the sample by specific star-formation rate, concentration index, and stellar mass, each subsample’s emission line surface brightness profiles and ratios differ, indicating that extra-planar gas properties can vary. The emission line surface brightnesses of the gas around high specific star-formation rate galaxies are higher at all distances, and the line ratios are closer to ratios characteristic of H ii regions compared with low specific star-formation rate galaxies. The less concentrated and lower stellar mass samples exhibit line ratios that are more like H ii regions at larger distances than their more concentrated and higher stellar mass counterparts. The largest difference between different subsamples occurs when the galaxies are split by stellar mass. We additionally infer that gas far from the midplane in more massive galaxies has the highest temperatures and steepest radial temperature gradients based on their [N ii]/Hα and [O ii]/Hα ratios between the disk and the halo."

The laws of the iterated logarithm are new even in the standard model when only one ball is drawn from the urn in each step (except for the classical Polya urn model).

Step-by-step tutorials break the complex task of sketching an entire object down into easy-to-follow steps that even a novice can follow. However, creating such tutorials requires expert knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, the availability of tutorials for a given object or viewpoint is limited. How2Sketch (H2S) addresses this problem by automatically generating easy-to-follow tutorials for arbitrary 3D objects. Given a segmented 3D model and a camera viewpoint, H2S computes a sequence of steps for constructing a drawing scaffold comprised of geometric primitives, which helps the user draw the final contours in correct perspective and proportion. To make the drawing scaffold easy to construct, the algorithm solves for an ordering among the scaffolding primitives and explicitly makes small geometric modifications to the size and location of the object parts to simplify relative positioning. Technically, we formulate this scaffold construction as a single selection problem that simultaneously solves for the ordering and geometric changes of the primitives. We generate different tutorials on man-made objects using our method and evaluate how easily the tutorials can be followed with a user study."

Graph.,2017,11,"Abstract Sketch recognition is the task of converting hand-drawn digital ink into symbolic computer representations. Since the early days of sketch recognition, the bulk of the work in the field focused on building accurate recognition algorithms for specific domains, and well defined data sets. Recognition methods explored so far have been developed and evaluated using standard machine learning pipelines and have consequently been built over many simplifying assumptions. For example, existing frameworks assume the presence of a fixed set of symbol classes, and the availability of plenty of annotated examples. However, in practice, these assumptions do not hold. In reality, the designer of a sketch recognition system starts with no labeled data at all, and faces the burden of data annotation. In this work, we propose to alleviate the burden of annotation by building systems that can learn from very few labeled examples, and large amounts of unlabeled data. Our systems perform self-learning by automatically extending a very small set of labeled examples with new examples extracted from unlabeled sketches. The end result is a sufficiently large set of labeled training data, which can subsequently be used to train classifiers. We present four self-learning methods with varying levels of implementation difficulty and runtime complexities. One of these methods leverages contextual co-occurrence patterns to build verifiably more diverse set of training instances. Rigorous experiments with large sets of data demonstrate that this novel approach based on exploiting contextual information leads to significant leaps in recognition performance. As a side contribution, we also demonstrate the utility of bagging for sketch recognition in imbalanced data sets with few positive examples and many outliers."

We train a deep generative model to learn the joint distribution of sketch and the corresponding image by using joint images. Our deep contextual completion approach has several advantages. First, the simple joint image representation allows for simple and effective definition of losses in the same joint image-sketch space, which avoids complicated issues in cross-domain learning. Second, while the output is related to its input overall, the generated features exhibit more freedom in appearance and do not strictly align with the input features. Third, from the joint image's point of view, image and sketch are of no difference, thus exactly the same deep joint image completion network can be used for image-to-sketch generation. Experiments evaluated on three different datasets show that the proposed approach can generate more realistic images than the state-ofthe- arts on challenging inputs and generalize well on common categories."

To address this, we further introduce a dedicated comic style CNN, which is trained for classifying comic images and photos. This new network is effective in capturing various comic styles and thus helps to produce better comic stylization results. Even with a grayscale style image, Gatys's method can still produce colored output, which is not desirable for comics. We develop a modified optimization framework such that a grayscale image is guaranteed to be synthesized.

In order to maximize the controllability of face attributes, an attribute-disentangled variational auto-encoder (AD-VAE) is firstly introduced to learn latent representations disentangled with respect to specified attributes. Then we conduct photo synthesis from simple line drawing based on AD-VAE.

This combination allows their use as benchmark test, in order to improve the knowledge concerning the numerical simulation models, through the comparison between experimental and numerical results.

The numerical simulation is performed using the finite element code ABAQUS, with solid and solid-shell elements, in order to compare the computational efficiency of these type of elements. The results show that the solid-shell element is more cost-effective than the solid, presenting global accurate predictions, excepted for the thinning zones.

The goal of caricature recognition is to match a caricature with a photo. This recognition process needs to deal with all kind of variations including different modalities, facial appearance exaggerations, changes in viewpoint, expression, and illumination, etc. All these variations lead to severe misalignment between features of caricatures and photos. To deal with these problems, a specifically designed facial landmark based feature extraction scheme is proposed, where features of caricatures and photos are extracted using different feature extraction steps. At each facial landmark, features of photos are extracted with fixed viewing angle and scale, while features of caricatures are extracted with different scales and viewing angles. To measure the similarity of these features, multiple cross-modal metrics are learned at different facial landmarks in one optimization framework to guarantee global optimum. As the measured features are from two modalities (caricature and photo), cross-modal metric is used to remove modality variations. Pooling at distance level is used during metric optimization to further align the features of caricatures and photos. The introduced pooling step makes the learning method more robust to variations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two caricature datasets with various variations."

In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a novel composition-aided generative adversarial network (CA-GAN) for sketch portrait generation. First, we utilize paired inputs including a face photo and the corresponding pixel-wise face labels for generating the portrait. Second, we propose an improved pixel loss, termed compositional loss, to focus training on hard-generated components and delicate facial structures. Moreover, we use stacked CA-GANs (stack-CA-GAN) to further rectify defects and add compelling details. Experimental results show that our method is capable of generating identity-preserving, sketch-realistic, and visually comfortable sketch portraits over a wide range of challenging data, and outperforms existing methods.

Numerical experiments suggest that our approach is more efficient than the state-of-the-art sketched clustering algorithms (in both computational and sample complexity) and more efficient than k-means++ in certain regimes."

To tackle this problem, we propose a probabilistic framework based on Multi-View Pairwise Relationship (MVPR) learning. Our framework includes multiple views of 3D shapes as the intermediate layer between sketches and 3D shapes, and transforms the original retrieval problem into the form of inferring pairwise relationship between sketches and views. We accomplish pairwise relationship inference by a novel MVPR net, which can automatically predict and merge the pairwise relationships between a sketch and multiple views, thus freeing us from exhaustively selecting the best view of 3D shapes. We also propose to learn robust features for sketches and views via fine-tuning pre-trained networks. Extensive experiments on a large dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art methods significantly."

In this paper, we address this issue from the motion-level perspective by using hand-drawn sketches as queries. Motion sketch based crowd video retrieval naturally suffers from challenges in crowd motion representation and similarity measurement. To tackle them, we propose to (1) leverage the motion structure coding algorithm for motion-level video indexing and hand-drawn sketch representation and (2) exploit distance metric fusion strategy incorporated with Ranking SVM for measuring the relevant degree between a sketch query and crowd videos. Specifically, for video indexing, motion decomposition is utilized to separate sub-motion vector fields with typical patterns from a set of optical flows. Then, the motion-level descriptors of the vector fields are computed and stored in an index database. To represent motion sketches, we propose a mechanism by vectorizing the sketches followed by motion structure coding. In the retrieval stage, we first compute the pairwise distance with different metrics between a new sketch query and crowd videos, and then stack them into a feature vector as the input of the Ranking SVM algorithm. Finally, we use the learned retrieval model to predict the ranking score of each crowd video in the database. Experimental results on the publicly available crowd datasets show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed sketch based crowd video retrieval system."

Promising results on the problem of sketch-photo face hallucination have been achieved with classic, and increasingly deep learning-based methods. However, synthesized photos still lack the crisp fidelity of real photos. More importantly, good results have primarily been demonstrated on very constrained datasets where the style variability is very low, and crucially the sketches are perfectly align-able traces of the ground-truth photos. However, realistic applications in entertainment or law enforcement require working with more unconstrained sketches drawn from memory or description, which are not rigidly align-able. In this paper, we develop a new deep learning approach to address these settings. Our image-image regression network is trained with a combination of content and adversarial losses to generate crisp photorealistic images, and it contains an integrated spatial transformer network to deal with non-rigid alignment between the domains. We evaluate face synthesis on classic constrained, as well as unviewed, benchmarks namely CUHK, MGDB, and FSMD. The results qualitatively and quantitatively outperform existing approaches."

Most existing methods either ignore the geometric characteristics or treat sketches as handwritten characters with fixed structural ordering. Consequently, they can hardly yield high recognition performance even though sophisticated learning techniques are employed. In this paper, we propose a sequential deep learning strategy that combines both shape and texture features. A coded shape descriptor is exploited to characterize the geometry of sketch strokes with high flexibility, while the outputs of constitutional neural networks (CNN) are taken as the abstract texture feature. We develop dual deep networks with memorable gated recurrent units (GRUs), and sequentially feed these two types of features into the dual networks, respectively. These dual networks enable the feature fusion by another gated recurrent unit (GRU), and thus accurately recognize sketches invariant to stroke ordering.

The capability of a child to easily spot the style was shown to be valid for other illustrators such as Axel Scheffler and Debi Gliori. The boy's enthusiasm let us to start the journey to explore the capabilities of machines to recognize the style of illustrators. We collected pages from children's books to construct a new illustrations dataset consisting of about 6500 pages from 24 artists. We exploited deep networks for categorizing illustrators and with around 94% classification performance our method over-performed the traditional methods by more than 10%.

Graph. Forum,2017,6,"Sketching is a simple and natural way of expression and communication for humans. For this reason, it gains increasing popularity in human computer interaction, with the emergence of multitouch tablets and styluses. In recent years, sketch‐based interactive methods are widely used in many retrieval systems. In particular, a variety of sketch‐based 3D model retrieval works have been presented. However, almost all of these works focus on directly matching sketches with the projection views of 3D models, and they suffer from the large differences between the sketch drawing and the views of 3D models, leading to unsatisfying retrieval results. Therefore, in this paper, during the matching procedure in the retrieval, we propose to match the sketch with each 3D model from historical users instead of projection views. Yet since the sketches between the current user and the historical users can have big difference, we also aim to handle users' personalized deviations and differences. To this end, we leverage recommendation algorithms to estimate the drawing style characteristic similarity between the current user and historical users. Experimental results on the Large Scale Sketch Track Benchmark(SHREC14LSSTB) demonstrate that our method outperforms several state‐of‐the‐art methods."

In this work, we focus on deep convolutional neural network architectures, and propose a novel randomized tensor sketching technique that we utilize to develop a unified framework for approximating the operation of both the convolutional and fully connected layers. By applying the sketching technique along different tensor dimensions, we design changes to the convolutional and fully connected layers that substantially reduce the number of effective parameters in a network.

Image retrieval prima facie seems like a task that could profit from combined symbolic and iconic reference, but it is typically set up to work either from language only, or via (iconic) sketches with no verbal contribution. Using a model of grounded language semantics and a model of sketch-to-image mapping, we show that adding even very reduced iconic information to a verbal image description improves recall. Verbal descriptions paired with fully detailed sketches still perform better than these sketches alone. We see these results as supporting the assumption that natural user interfaces should respond to multimodal input, where possible, rather than just language alone."

Our analysis shows that fixation sequences exhibit marked consistency within a sketch, across sketches of a category and even across suitably grouped sets of categories. This multi-level consistency is remarkable given the variability in depiction and extreme image content sparsity that characterizes hand-drawn object sketches. In this paper, we show that the multi-level consistency in the fixation data can be exploited to 1) predict a test sketch’s category given only its fixation sequence and 2) build a computational model which predicts part-labels underlying fixations on objects.

For example, the inpainting approach tends to blur the generated region when the missing area is large (i.e., more than 50%). In this paper, we exploit the potential of deep learning networks in filling large missing region (e.g., as high as 95% missing) and generating realistic faces with high-fidelity in cross domains. We propose the recursive generation by bidirectional transformation networks (rBTN) that recursively generates a whole face/sketch from a small sketch/face patch. The large missing area and the cross domain challenge make it difficult to generate satisfactory results using a unidirectional cross-domain learning structure. On the other hand, a forward and backward bidirectional learning between the face and sketch domains would enable recursive estimation of the missing region in an incremental manner (Fig. 1) and yield appealing results. r-BTN also adopts an adversarial constraint to encourage the generation of realistic faces/sketches. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance from r-BTN as compared to existing potential solutions."

Two models, fitness evaluation model and parameter estimation model, are learned for case retrieval and adaptation respectively from these cases. The fitness evaluation model is to decide which case is best-fitted to the sketching of current interest, and the parameter estimation model is to automate case adaptation. The resultant sketch is synthesized progressively with an iterative loop of retrieval and adaptation of candidate cases until the desired aesthetic style is achieved. To explore the effectiveness and advantages of the novel approach, we experimentally compare the sketch portraits generated by the proposed method with that of a state-of-the-art example-based facial sketch generation algorithm as well as a couple commercial software packages.

We propose a new network structure with a joint loss by combining a simple classification loss with a robust histogram loss to learn better deep features for both sketch and image. The joint loss method has nearly no parameters to tune; it can not only learn the difference between image/sketch samples from different semantic class but also capture the fine-grained similarity between image/sketch samples in the same semantic class. In the experiments, we show the proposed method obtains excellent performance in real-time on the standard sketch-based image retrieval benchmark."

Specifically, the time-varying contextual non-linear mapping between audio stream and visual facial movements is realized by training a LSTM neural network on a large audio-visual data corpus. In this work, we extract a set of acoustic features from input audio, including Mel-scaled spectrogram, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and chromagram that can effectively represent both contextual progression and emotional intensity of the speech. Output facial movements are characterized by 3D rotation and blending expression weights of a blendshape model, which can be used directly for animation. Thus, even though our model does not explicitly predict the affective states of the target speaker, her emotional manifestation is recreated via expression weights of the face model. Experiments on an evaluation dataset of different speakers across a wide range of affective states demonstrate promising results of our approach in real-time speech-driven facial animation."

(Apprentissage de modèles de mélange à large échelle par Sketching),,2017,1,"Learning parameters from voluminous data can be prohibitive in terms of memory and computational requirements. We propose a "" compressive learning "" framework where we estimate model parameters from a sketch of the training data. This sketch is a collection of generalized moments of the underlying probability distribution of the data. It can be computed in a single pass on the training set, and is easily computable on streams or distributed datasets. The proposed framework shares similarities with compressive sensing, which aims at drastically reducing the dimension of high-dimensional signals while preserving the ability to reconstruct them. To perform the estimation task, we derive an iterative algorithm analogous to sparse reconstruction algorithms in the context of linear inverse problems. We exemplify our framework with the compressive estimation of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), providing heuristics on the choice of the sketching procedure and theoretical guarantees of reconstruction. We experimentally show on synthetic data that the proposed algorithm yields results comparable to the classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) technique while requiring significantly less memory and fewer computations when the number of database elements is large. We further demonstrate the potential of the approach on real large-scale data (over 10 8 training samples) for the task of model-based speaker verification. Finally, we draw some connections between the proposed framework and approximate Hilbert space embedding of probability distributions using random features. We show that the proposed sketching operator can be seen as an innovative method to design translation-invariant kernels adapted to the analysis of GMMs. We also use this theoretical framework to derive information preservation guarantees, in the spirit of infinite-dimensional compressive sensing."

These tools often need to employ tricky, custom-built synthesis algorithms because they require synthesized programs to be not only correct, but also optimal with respect to a desired cost metric, such as program size. Finding these optimal solutions efficiently requires domain-specific search strategies, but existing synthesizers hard-code the strategy, making them difficult to reuse. This paper presents metasketches, a general framework for specifying and solving optimal synthesis problems. metasketches make the search strategy a part of the problem definition by specifying a fragmentation of the search space into an ordered set of classic sketches. We provide two cooperating search algorithms to effectively solve metasketches. A global optimizing search coordinates the activities of local searches, informing them of the costs of potentially-optimal solutions as they explore different regions of the candidate space in parallel. The local searches execute an incremental form of counterexample-guided inductive synthesis to incorporate information sent from the global search. We present Synapse, an implementation of these algorithms, and show that it effectively solves optimal synthesis problems with a variety of different cost functions. In addition, metasketches can be used to accelerate classic (non-optimal) synthesis by explicitly controlling the search strategy, and we show that Synapse solves classic synthesis problems that state-of-the-art tools cannot."

In the proposed method, a sparse representation-based greedy search strategy is first applied to estimate an initial sketch. Then, multi-scale features and Euclidean distance are employed to select candidate image patches from the initial estimated sketch and the template sketch.

Thus, our framework can enable interesting applications such as camera-equipped robots playing the popular party game Pictionary with human players and generating sparsified yet recognizable sketches of objects."

A broad spectrum of systems, such as information, communication, and social, are naturally represented by dynamic graphs. Outlier (or anomaly) detection in dynamic graphs can provide unique insights into the relationships of objects and identify novel or emerging relationships. To date, outlier detection in dynamic graphs has been studied in the context of graph streams, focusing on the analysis and comparison of entire graph objects. However, the volume and velocity of data are necessitating a transition from outlier detection in the context of graph streams to outlier detection in the context of edge streams–where the stream consists of individual graph edges instead of entire graph objects. In this paper, we propose the first approach for outlier detection in edge streams. We first describe a highlevel model for outlier detection based on global and local structural properties of a stream. We propose a novel application of the Count-Min sketch for approximating these properties, and prove probabilistic error bounds on our edge outlier scoring functions. Our sketch-based implementation provides a scalable solution, having constant time updates and constant space requirements. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate our method’s scalability, effectiveness for discovering outliers, and the effects of approximation."

We introduce a novel GAN architecture with design features that make it suitable for sketch retrieval. The performance of this sketch-GAN is compared to a modified version of the original GAN architecture with respect to simple invariance properties.

However, they neglect the semantic aspect of retrieval, i.e., what meaningful object properties does a user try encode in her/his sketch? We propose a fine-grained SBIR model that exploits semantic attributes and deep feature learning in a complementary way. Specifically, we perform multi-task deep learning with three objectives, including: retrieval by fine-grained ranking on a learned representation, attribute prediction, and attribute-level ranking. Simultaneously predicting semantic attributes and using such predictions in the ranking procedure help retrieval results to be more semantically relevant. Importantly, the introduction of semantic attribute learning in the model allows for the elimination of the otherwise prohibitive cost of human annotations required for training a fine-grained deep ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on challenging fine-grained SBIR benchmarks while requiring less annotation."

In this paper, for the first time we formulate a cross-domain framework specifically designed for the task of FG-SBIR that simultaneously conducts instance-level retrieval and attribute prediction. Different to conventional photo-text cross-domain frameworks that performs transfer on category-level data, our joint multi-view space uniquely learns from the instance-level pair-wise annotations of sketch and photo. More specifically, we propose a joint view selection and attribute subspace learning algorithm to learn domain projection matrices for photo and sketch, respectively. It follows that visual attributes can be extracted from such matrices through projection to build a coupled semantic space to conduct retrieval.

This naturally motivates us to study the effectiveness of various cross-modal retrieval methods in SBIR. However, to the best of our knowledge, all established cross-modal algorithms are designed to traverse the more conventional cross-modal gap of image and text, making their general applicableness to SBIR unclear.

By performing instance-level (rather than category-level) retrieval, it embodies a timely and practical application, particularly with the ubiquitous availability of touchscreens. Three factors contribute to the challenging nature of the problem: (i) free-hand sketches are inherently abstract and iconic, making visual comparisons with photos more difficult, (ii) sketches and photos are in two different visual domains, i.e. black and white lines vs. color pixels, and (iii) fine-grained distinctions are especially challenging when executed across domain and abstraction-level. To address this, we propose to detect visual attributes at part-level, in order to build a new representation that not only captures fine-grained characteristics but also traverses across visual domains. More specifically, (i) we propose a dataset with 304 photos and 912 sketches, where each sketch and photo is annotated with its semantic parts and associated part-level attributes, and with the help of this dataset, we investigate (ii) how strongly-supervised deformable part-based models can be learned that subsequently enable automatic detection of part-level attributes, and (iii) a novel matching framework that synergistically integrates low-level features, mid-level geometric structure and high-level semantic attributes to boost retrieval performance.

This study investigates visuomotor memory (VM), which is a reusable memory storing drawing behavioral data. We propose a neural network-based model for acquiring a computational memory that can replicate VM through self-organized learning of a robot’s actual drawing experiences. To design the model, we assume that VM has the following two characteristics: (1) it is formed by bottom-up learning and integration of temporal drawn pictures and motion data, and (2) it allows the observers to associate drawing motions from pictures. The proposed model comprises a deep neural network for dimensionally compressing temporal drawn images and a continuous-time recurrent neural network for integration learning of drawing motions and temporal drawn images. Two experiments are conducted on unicursal shape learning to investigate whether the proposed model can learn the function without any shape information for visual processing. Based on the first experiment, the model can learn 15 drawing sequences for three types of pictures, acquiring associative memory for drawing motions through the bottom-up learning process. Thus, it can associate drawing motions from untrained drawn images. In the second experiment, four types of pictures are trained, with four distorted variations per type. In this case, the model can organize the different shapes based on their distortions by utilizing both the image information and the drawing motions, even if visual characteristics are not shared."

The aim of this paper is to show how the introduction of energy terms related to the micro-deformation mechanisms of the fabric, in particular to the bending stiffness of the yarns, helps in the modelling of the mechanical behaviour of this kind of materials. To this aim, a second gradient, hyperelastic, initially orthotropic continuum theory is proposed to model fibrous composite interlocks at finite strains. In particular, the present work explores the relationship between the onset of wrinkling during the simulation of the deep drawing of a woven fabric and the use of a second gradient model. It is shown that the introduction of second gradient terms accounting for the description of in-plane and out-of-plane bending rigidities decreases the onset of wrinkles during the simulation of deep drawing. In this work, a quadratic energy, roughly proportional to the square of the curvature of the fibres, is presented and implemented in the simulations. This simple constitutive assumption allows the effects of the second gradient energy on both the wrinkling description and the numerical stability of the model to be clearly shown. The results obtained in second gradient simulations are descriptive of the experimental evidence of deep drawing whose description is targeted in this work. The present paper provides additional evidence of the fact that first gradient continuum theories alone cannot be considered fully descriptive of the behaviour of dry woven composite reinforcements. On the other hand, the proposed second gradient model for fibrous composite reinforcements opens the way both to the more accurate simulation of complex forming processes and to the possibility of controlling the onset of wrinkles."

Understanding this phenomenon is of particular importance for many modern applications of subspace clustering where one would like to subsample in order to improve computational efficiency. Examples include real-time video surveillance and datasets so large that cannot even be stored in memory. In this paper we introduce a new metric between subspaces, which we call partial coordinate discrepancy. This metric captures a notion of similarity between subsampled subspaces that is not captured by other distance measures between subspaces. With this, we are able to show that subspace clustering is theoretically possible in lieu of coherence assumptions using only r + 1 rows of the dataset at hand. This gives precise information-theoretic necessary and sufficient conditions for sketched subspace clustering. This can greatly improve computational efficiency without compromising performance.

How a human expresses a shape is a consequence of how he or she visualizes it. A query-by-sketch 3D object retrieval application is closely tied to this concept from two aspects. First, describing sketches must involve elements in a figure that matter most to a human. Second, the representative 2D projection of the target 3D objects should be limited to “the canonical views” from a human cognition perspective. We advocate for these two rules by presenting a new approach for sketch-based 3D object retrieval that describes a 2D shape by the visual protruding parts of its silhouette. Furthermore, we present a list of candidate 2D projections that represent the canonical views of a 3D object. The general rule is that humans would visually avoid part occlusion and symmetry. We quantify the extent of part occlusion of the projected silhouettes of 3D objects by skeletal length computations. Sorting the projected views in the decreasing order of skeletal lengths gives access to a subset of the best representative views. We experimentally show how views that cause misinterpretation and mismatching can be detected according to the part occlusion criteria.

Specifically, for a norm $\|\cdot\|$, sparsity parameter $k$, approximation factor $K>0$, and probability of failure $P>0$, we ask: what is the minimal value of $m$ so that there is a distribution over $m \times n$ matrices $A$ with the property that for any $x$, given $Ax$, we can recover a $k$-sparse approximation to $x$ in the given norm with probability at least $1-P$? We give a partial answer to this problem, by showing that for norms that admit efficient linear sketches, the optimal number of measurements $m$ is closely related to the doubling dimension of the metric induced by the norm $\|\cdot\|$ on the set of all $k$-sparse vectors. By applying our result to specific norms, we cast known measurement bounds in our general framework (for the $\ell_p$ norms, $p \in [1,2]$) as well as provide new, measurement-efficient schemes (for the Earth-Mover Distance norm). The latter result directly implies more succinct linear sketches for the well-studied planar $k$-median clustering problem.

We create the first scene sketch dataset ""Scene250"" and propose a deep learning method to understand human scene sketches. We propose ""Scene-Net"", a new deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, based on which we build a novel scene sketch recognition system.

There is evidence that these additional cues facilitate image recognition in individuals with and without neurological deficits. Black-and-white line drawings and colour photographs are commonly used with individuals with aphasia in evaluation and treatment. Eye tracking provides an opportunity to assess the influence of these different image types on object recognition processes without relying on verbal responses. Aims: The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in object recognition of photographs and line drawings were observed using eye-tracking measures. Specific goals were to compare the influence of (a) image type of the same target image presented as colour photograph and black-and-white line drawing and (b) degree of colour diagnosticity (high-colour diagnostic natural objects and low-colour diagnostic human-made objects) in multiple-choice image displays on language-mediated eye movements in language-normal adults. Methods & Procedures: Eye movements of 19 participants were recorded while they viewed 66 multiple-choice image displays of colour photographs and black-and-white line drawings presented with a verbal stimulus. Target images included high-colour diagnostic natural objects and low-colour diagnostic human-made objects. Outcomes & Results: Participants allocated significantly greater proportions of fixation duration and first-pass gaze duration to the photographs compared to line drawings. No significant differences were observed for colour diagnosticity differences within the colour or the black-and-white line drawing displays. Conclusions: Eye tracking indexed significant differences in fixation duration allocated to target images in displays that only differed with respect to image type and colour, and were otherwise carefully controlled for shape, size, orientation, and content conveyed. Results suggest that language-normal participants’ object recognition was facilitated by colour photographs compared to line drawings, highlighting the clinical relevance and the need for research of image design for clinical use with individuals with neurological impairments."

A codebook is organized in a hierarchical vocabulary tree, which maintains structural information of visual words and enables efficient retrieval in sub-linear time.

We propose compact linear sketches for reducing the dimensionality of the input, followed by a single layer neural network. We show that any sparse polynomial function can be computed, on nearly all sparse binary vectors, by a single layer neural network that takes a compact sketch of the vector as input. Consequently, when a set of sparse binary vectors is approximately separable using a sparse polynomial, there exists a single-layer neural network that takes a short sketch as input and correctly classifies nearly all the points. Previous work has proposed using sketches to reduce dimensionality while preserving the hypothesis class. However, the sketch size has an exponential dependence on the degree in the case of polynomial classifiers. In stark contrast, our approach of using improper learning, using a larger hypothesis class allows the sketch size to have a logarithmic dependence on the degree. Even in the linear case, our approach allows us to improve on the pesky $O({1}/{{\gamma}^2})$ dependence of random projections, on the margin $\gamma$. We empirically show that our approach leads to more compact neural networks than related methods such as feature hashing at equal or better performance."

Currently, most sketch synthesis algorithms focus on generating face portrait of good quality, but ignoring the time consumption. Existing methods have large time complexity due to dense computation of patch matching in the neighbor selection process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective fast face sketch synthesis method based on K dimensional-Tree (KD-Tree). The proposed method employs the idea of divide-and-conquer (i.e. piece-wise linear) to learn the complex nonlinear mapping between facial photos and sketches. In the training phase, all the training images are divided into regions and every region is divided into some small patches, then KD-Tree is built up among training photo patches in each region. In the test phase, the test photo is first divided into some patches as the same way in the training phase. KD-Tree search is conducted for K nearest neighbor selection by matching the test photo patches in each region against the constructed KD-Tree of training photo patches in the same region. The KD-Tree process builds index structure which greatly reduces the time consumption for neighbor selection. Compared with synthesis methods using classical greedy search strategy (i.e. KNN), the proposed method is much less time consuming but with comparable synthesis performance. Experiments on the public CUHK face sketch (CUFS) database illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the proposed neighbor selection strategy can be further extended to other synthesis algorithms."

Given a directed graph \(G=(V,A)\) and a maximal height, we propose a layering approach that minimizes a weighted sum of the number of reversed arcs, the arc lengths, and the width of the drawing. We call this the Compact Generalized Layering Problem (CGLP). Here, the width of a drawing is defined as the maximum sum of the number of vertices placed on a layer and the number of dummy vertices caused by arcs traversing the layer. The CGLP is \(\mathcal {NP}\)-hard. We present two MIP models for this problem. The first one (EXT) is our extension of a natural formulation for directed acyclic graphs as suggested by Healy and Nikolov. The second one (CGL) is a new formulation based on partial orderings. Our computational experiments on two benchmark sets show that the CGL formulation can be solved much faster than EXT using standard commercial MIP solvers. Moreover, we suggest a variant of CGL, called MML, that can be seen as a heuristic approach. In our experiments, MML clearly improves on CGL in terms of running time while it does not considerably increase the average arc lengths and widths of the layouts although it solves a slightly different problem where the dummy vertices are not taken into account."

The research was aimed at exploring the potential use of wireless sensor networks as an early-warning system to help mitigate human-wildlife conflicts occurring at the edge of a forest. There are three important features to the development. Firstly, the sensor platform employs multiple sensors arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array to give it a key spatial-resolution capability that aids in classification. Secondly, given the challenges of collecting data involving animal intrusion, an Animation-based Simulation tool for Passive Infra-Red sEnsor (ASPIRE) was developed that simulates signals corresponding to human and animal intrusion and some limited models of vegetative clutter. This speeded up the process of algorithm development by allowing us to test different hypotheses in a time-efficient manner. Finally, a chirplet-based model for intruder signal was developed that significantly helped boost classification accuracy despite drawing data from a smaller number of sensors. An SVM-based classifier was used which made use of chirplet, energy and signal cross-correlation-based features. The average accuracy obtained for intruder detection and classification on real-world and simulated data sets was in excess of 97%."

With the rising need to digitize manga, segmenting texture regions from manga has become an indispensable basis for almost all manga processing, from vectorization to colorization. Unfortunately, such texture segmentation is not easy since textures in manga are composed of lines and exhibit similar features to structural lines (contour lines). So currently, texture segmentation is still manually performed, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To extract a texture region, various texture features have been proposed for measuring texture similarity, but precise boundaries cannot be achieved since boundary pixels exhibit different features from inner pixels. In this paper, we propose a novel method which also adopts texture features to estimate texture regions. Unlike existing methods, the estimated texture region is only regarded an initial, imprecise texture region. We expand the initial texture region to the precise boundary based on local smoothness via a graph-cut formulation. This allows our method to extract texture regions with precise boundaries. We have applied our method to various manga images and satisfactory results were achieved in all cases."

Specifically, we perform multi-task deep learning with three objectives, including: retrieval by fine-grained ranking on a learned representation, attribute prediction, and attribute-level ranking. Simultaneously predicting semantic attributes and using such predictions in the ranking procedure help retrieval results to be more semantically relevant. Importantly, the introduction of semantic attribute learning in the model allows for the elimination of the otherwise prohibitive cost of human annotations required for training a fine-grained deep ranking model.

To reduce the exemplars needed for learning, we regress a collection of linear mappings defined locally in both face geometry and identity spaces and develop a progressive scheme for users to gradually add new exemplars for training. At runtime, our method first finds the nearby exemplars of an input real face and then constructs the result cartoon face from the corresponding cartoon faces of the nearby real face exemplars and the local deformations mapped from the real face subspace.

To handle such a drawback, we propose a robust face sketch style synthesis method, which can convert photos to arbitrarily stylistic sketches based on only one corresponding template sketch. In the proposed method, a sparse representation-based greedy search strategy is first applied to estimate an initial sketch. Then, multi-scale features and Euclidean distance are employed to select candidate image patches from the initial estimated sketch and the template sketch.

In contrast to the existing facial sketch synthesis systems, the proposed scheme aims to synthesize sketches, which reproduce the unique drawing style of a particular artist, where this drawing style is learned from a data set consisting of a large number of image/sketch pairwise training samples. The synthesis system comprises three modules, namely, a global module, a local module, and an enhancement module. The global module applies a 2DDCM approach to synthesize the global facial geometry and texture of the input image. The detailed texture is then added to the synthesized sketch in a local patch-based manner using a parametric 2DDCM model and a non-parametric Markov random field (MRF) network. Notably, the MRF approach gives the synthesized results an appearance more consistent with the drawing style of the training samples, while the 2DDCM approach enables the synthesis of outcomes with a more derivative style. As a result, the similarity between the synthesized sketches and the input images is greatly improved. Finally, a post-processing operation is performed to enhance the shadowed regions of the synthesized image by adding strong lines or curves to emphasize the lighting conditions. The experimental results confirm that the synthesized facial images are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the input images as well as the ground-truth sketches provided by the same artist.

However, these technologies may have a slower and less effect since acceptance of them by users is affected by many factors.  Therefore, it is extremely important to understand and reveal the factors which encourage teachers who are to choose the most appropriate tool and material for students during teaching period to use cartoons for teaching or restrict their use. To this end, teachers’ perceptions, attitudes, intentions and behaviors concerning the use of cartoons for teaching were examined and modeled according to Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). As a result of the analyses, data were obtained from 271 teachers who work in several provinces to test its relationship between the variables of perceived benefit, perceived ease of use, attitude towards use, intention of use and actual behavior stated in TAM. The data obtained were analyzed with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results show that the model gives different results from the ones foreseen in TAM. Moreover, it was seen according to the paired comparisons on the model that the only significant difference between females and males is attitude predicting strength of the perceived benefit

Comput.,2016,3,"We present techniques for improving performance driven facial animation, emotion recognition, and facial key-point or landmark prediction using learned identity invariant representations. Established approaches to these problems can work well if sufficient examples and labels for a particular identity are available and factors of variation are highly controlled. However, labeled examples of facial expressions, emotions and key-points for new individuals are difficult and costly to obtain. In this paper we improve the ability of techniques to generalize to new and unseen individuals by explicitly modeling previously seen variations related to identity and expression. We use a weakly-supervised approach in which identity labels are used to learn the different factors of variation linked to identity separately from factors related to expression. We show how probabilistic modeling of these sources of variation allows one to learn identity-invariant representations for expressions which can then be used to identity-normalize various procedures for facial expression analysis and animation control. We also show how to extend the widely used techniques of active appearance models and constrained local models through replacing the underlying point distribution models which are typically constructed using principal component analysis with identity-expression factorized representations. We present a wide variety of experiments in which we consistently improve performance on emotion recognition, markerless performance-driven facial animation and facial key-point tracking. Identity-expression disentanglement can improve performance driven facial animation.An identity-expression factorization approach can improve both AAMs and CLMs.Identity-expression disentanglement can improve facial expression recognition."

It also gains increasing popularity in human computer interaction, with the emergence of multitouch tablets and styluses. The main characteristics of sketches can be summarized in two aspects: (i) the fuzziness of the sketch information, which can be attributed to that the completeness of the sketch is evolving with the drawing process and there is no fixed mapping between the user expression and the sketch; (ii) the randomness of user input, arising from that users' input is not only associated with their field background, way of thinking, hand-painted habits and preferences, but also affected by types of equipments and environmental factors. These two characteristics make the sketch can express creative thinking, but it is also the two characteristics that make the freehand sketch recognition algorithm must have enough robustness to support user interaction. Neglecting the above two issues in previous studies causes the results to be less satisfactory. In recent years, sketch-based interactive methods are widely used in many retrieval systems. In particular, a variety of sketch-based 3D model retrieval works have been presented. However, almost all these works focus on directly matching sketches with the projection views of 3D models, and they suffer from the large differences between the sketch drawing and the views of 3D models, leading to unsatisfying retrieval results. Therefore, in this article, during the matching procedure in the retrieval, we propose to match the sketch with the ones of each 3D model from historical users instead of projection views. Yet since the sketches between the current user and the historical users can have big difference, we also study appropriate methods to handle users' personalized deviations and differences. To this end, we leverage recommendation algorithms to estimate the drawing style characteristic similarity between the current user and historical users."

Most real-world networks, from biological to social ones, are known to have common structural properties. These properties allow us to model the growth processes of networks and to develop useful algorithms. One remarkable example is the fractality of networks, which suggests the self-similar organization of global network structure. To determine the fractality of a network, we need to solve the so-called box-covering problem, where preceding algorithms are not feasible for large-scale networks. The lack of an efficient algorithm prevents us from investigating the fractal nature of large-scale networks. To overcome this issue, we propose a new box-covering algorithm based on recently emerging sketching techniques. We theoretically show that it works in near-linear time with a guarantee of solution accuracy. In experiments, we have confirmed that the algorithm enables us to study the fractality of million-scale networks for the first time. We have observed that its outputs are sufficiently accurate and that its time and space requirements are orders of magnitude smaller than those of previous algorithms."

In this paper, one training instance in the constraint is replaced by a pseudo center, which is generated during the sketching stage. Due to this change, our learning algorithm can focus on pushing every received sample to its corresponding similar pseudo center closer and pulling it far away from the dissimilar one. In addition, it can further achieve better performance of some kinds of time-varying process (e.g. on object tracking) than the compared related competitors. We demonstrate how to implement other methods in our algorithm framework and experiment to show that our method outperforms the competitors and relevant baselines on multiple datasets."

Furthermore, a technique called gravity shifting is utilized for taking over the problem of elongation of characters. The consequence of combining sketch and gravity techniques leaded to a language free character recognition method. This method can be implemented independently for real-time uses or in combination of other classifiers as a feature extraction algorithm.

Almost always in state of the art approaches a large amount of “best views” are computed for 3D models, with the hope that the query sketch matches one of these 2D projections of 3D models using predefined features. We argue that this two stage approach (view selection - matching) is pragmatic but also problematic because the “best views” are subjective and ambiguous, which makes the matching inputs obscure. This imprecise nature of matching further makes it challenging to choose features manually. Instead of relying on the elusive concept of “best views” and the hand-crafted features, we propose to define our views using a minimalism approach and learn features for both sketches and views. Specifically, we drastically reduce the number of views to only two predefined directions for the whole dataset. Then, we learn two Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), one for the views and one for the sketches. The loss function is defined on the within-domain as well as the cross-domain similarities. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method is significantly better than state of the art approaches, and outperforms them in all conventional metrics."

Our approach takes whole face photos as inputs and directly generates the corresponding sketch images with efficient inference and learning, in which the architecture is stacked by only convolutional kernels of very small sizes. To well capture the person identity during the photo-sketch transformation, we define our optimization objective in the form of joint generative discriminative minimization. In particular, a discriminative regularization term is incorporated into the photo-sketch generation, enhancing the discriminability of the generated person sketches against other individuals. Extensive experiments on several standard benchmarks suggest that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-arts in both photo sketch generation and face sketch verification."

We evaluate the performance of all the proposed techniques on the most diverse sketch dataset to date (Mathias et al., 2012), and offer detailed and systematic analyses of the performance of different features and representations, including a breakdown by sketch-super-category.

All-distances sketches (ADS) [Cohen 1997], are a powerful tool for scalable approximation of statistics. The sketch is a small size sample of the distance relation of a node which emphasizes closer nodes. Sketches for all nodes are computed using a nearly linear computation and estimators are applied to sketches of nodes to estimate their properties. We provide, for the first time, a unified exposition of ADS algorithms and applications. We present the historic inverse probability (HIP) estimators which are applied to the ADS of a node to estimate a large natural class of statistics. For the important special cases of neighborhood cardinalities (the number of nodes within some query distance) and closeness centralities, HIP estimators have at most half the variance of previous estimators and we show that this is essentially optimal. Moreover, HIP obtains a polynomial improvement for more general statistics and the estimators are simple, flexible, unbiased, and elegant. For approximate distinct counting on data streams, HIP outperforms the original estimators for the HyperLogLog MinHash sketches (Flajolet et al. 2007), obtaining significantly improved estimation quality for this state-of-the-art practical algorithm."

Cylindrical cups were prepared with a heated die and blank-holder. The split-ring test was used to measure the effects of the temperature on the springback process from room temperature to 200 °C. Temperatures above 150 °C were found to greatly affect the force/displacement response during the forming process and the ironing phase, the earing profile and the springback effect. Tensile and shear tests were also performed to study the temperature-dependent mechanical responses. To simulate this process, a temperature-dependent anisotropic model for the material was implemented in the commercial code ABAQUS/Standard, based on the UMAT interface for user-material models. The parameters of a phenomenological Hockett–Sherby hardening model and a power law strain rate dependency were identified using data obtained in uniaxial tensile and shear tests at various temperatures and strain rates, in order to account for both the temperature and the viscous effects in the coupled thermomechanical constitutive law. Von Mises isotropic criterion and Hill׳48 anisotropic yield criterion were also adopted to describe the material mechanical behaviour. The influence of the contact with friction conditions in the forming process (i.e. punch force evolution, thickness distribution along the cup wall and earing profiles) was also analysed. The numerical results obtained with the calibrated parameters generally showed a good match with the experimental temperatures. The results highlighted the importance of the correct choice of the yield criteria. The Hill48 criterion showed difficulties in the correct prediction of the springback process for this aluminium alloy."

Although there is much research on face sketch synthesis, most existing algorithms cannot handle some nonfacial factors, such as hair style, hairpins, and glasses if these factors are excluded in the training set. In addition, previous methods only work on well controlled conditions and fail on images with different backgrounds and sizes as the training set. To this end, this paper presents a novel method that combines both the similarity between different image patches and prior knowledge to synthesize face sketches. Given training photo-sketch pairs, the proposed method learns a photo patch feature dictionary from the training photo patches and replaces the photo patches with their sparse coefficients during the searching process. For a test photo patch, we first obtain its sparse coefficient via the learnt dictionary and then search its nearest neighbors (candidate patches) in the whole training photo patches with sparse coefficients. After purifying the nearest neighbors with prior knowledge, the final sketch corresponding to the test photo can be obtained by Bayesian inference. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) we relax the nearest neighbor search area from local region to the whole image without too much time consuming and 2) our method can produce nonfacial factors that are not contained in the training set and is robust against image backgrounds and can even ignore the alignment and image size aspects of test photos.

We make use of ConvNets features as a basis for similarity search using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). Evaluation are performed on the TU-Berlin benchmark. Our main contributions are threefold: first, we use ConvNets in contrast to most previous approaches based essentially on hand crafted features. Secondly, we propose a ConvNet that is both more accurate and lighter/faster than the two only previous attempts at making use of ConvNets for handsketch recognition. We reached an accuracy of 75.42%. Third, we shown that similarly to their application on natural images, ConvNets allow the extraction of medium-level and high-level features (depending on the depth) which can be used for similarity search.1"

The existence of noisy edges on photo- realistic images is a key factor in the enlargement of the appearance gap and significantly degrades retrieval performance . To bridge the gap, we propose a framework consisting of a new line segment -based descriptor named histogram of line relationship (HLR) and a new noise impact reduction algorithm known as object boundary selection . HLR treats sketches and extracted edges of photo- realistic images as a series of piece-wise line segments and captures the relationship between them. Based on the HLR, the object boundary selection algorithm aims to reduce the impact of noisy edges by selecting the shaping edges that best correspond to the object boundaries. Multiple hypotheses are generated for descriptors by hypothetical edge selection. The selection algorithm is formulated to find the best combination of hypotheses to maximize the retrieval score; a fast method is also proposed. To reduce the distraction of false matches in the scoring process, two constraints on spatial and coherent aspects are introduced . We tested the HLR descriptor and the proposed framework on public datasets and a new image dataset of three million images, which we recently collected for SBIR evaluation purposes. We compared the proposed HLR with state-of-the-art descriptors (SHoG, GF-HOG). The experimental results show that our HLR descriptor outperforms them. Combined with the object boundary selection algorithm, our framework significantly improves SBIR performance."

However, the model trained on ImageNet fails on recognising the sketches, because the data source is dominated by photos and all kinds of sketches are roughly labelled as ‘cartoon’ rather than their own categorises (e.g., ‘cat’). Most of sketch recognition methods still heavily rely on the hand-craft feature extraction techniques, thus it is interesting to know whether DNNs can eliminate the needs of specific feature engineering in this area, and how the architecture is designed for sketch recognition purpose. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first deep neural network model for sketch classification, and it has outperformed stateof-the-art results in the TU-Berlin sketch benchmark. Based on that, we outline a sketch image retrieval system in a unified neural network framework."

In this paper, we introduce a novel (unsupervised) anomaly detection framework which can be used to detect anomalies in a streaming fashion by making only one pass over the data while utilizing limited storage. We adapt ideas from matrix sketching to maintain, in a streaming model, a set of few orthogonal vectors that form a good approximate basis for all the observed data. Using this constructed orthogonal basis, anomalies in new incoming data are detected based on a simple reconstruction error test. We theoretically prove that our algorithm compares favorably with an offline approach based on expensive global singular value decomposition (SVD) updates. Additionally, we apply ideas from randomized low-rank matrix approximations to further speedup the algorithm. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach over other popular scalable anomaly detection approaches."

Building on random sampling and consensus (RANSAC) ideas pursued earlier in a different (computer vision) context for robust regression, a suite of novel dimensionality- and set-reduction algorithms is developed. The advocated sketch-and-validate (SkeVa) family includes two algorithms that rely on K-means clustering per iteration on reduced number of dimensions and/or feature vectors: The first operates in a batch fashion, while the second sequential one offers computational efficiency and suitability with streaming modes of operation. For clustering even nonlinearly separable vectors, the SkeVa family offers also a member based on user-selected kernel functions. Further trading off performance for reduced complexity, a fourth member of the SkeVa family is based on a divergence criterion for selecting proper minimal subsets of feature variables and vectors, thus bypassing the need for K-means clustering per iteration. Extensive numerical tests on synthetic and real data sets highlight the potential of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate their competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art random projection alternatives."

In particular, we study how multiple Gestalt rules can be encapsulated into a unified perceptual grouping framework for sketch generation. We further show that by solving the problem of Gestalt confliction, i.e., encoding the relative importance of each rule, more similar to human-made sketches can be generated. For that, we release a manually labeled sketch dataset of 96 object categories and 7680 sketches. A novel evaluation framework is proposed to quantify human likeness of machine-generated sketches by examining how well they can be classified using models trained from human data.

Several authors have attempted to address this issue by creating synthetic data, or by building easy-to-use annotation tools. In this paper, we take a different approach, and demonstrate that the active learning technology can be used to reduce the amount of manual annotation required to achieve a target recognition accuracy.

Our system draws inspiration from a traditional illustration workflow: The user first sketches rough ‘masses’ of the object, as ellipses, to define an initial abstract pose that can then be refined with more detailed contours as desired. The system is made robust to partial or inaccurate sketches using a reduced‐dimensionality model of pose space learnt from a labelled collection of photos. Throughout the composition process, interactive visual feedback is provided to guide the user. Finally, the user's partial or complete sketch, complemented with appearance requirements, is used to constrain the automatic synthesis of a novel, high‐quality, realistic image."

After that, a list of frequent subgraphs is obtained using Frequent Subgraph Mining (FSM) techniques. For CBIR purpose, the recognition and ranking are done by checking for isomorphism between the graphs representing the query image versus the list of discovered frequent subgraphs.

Human sketch can easily express some complex user intention such as the object shape. However, sketches are sometimes ambiguous due to different drawing styles and inter-class object shape ambiguity. Although adding text queries as semantic information can help removing the ambiguity of sketch, it requires a huge amount of efforts to annotate text tags to all database clipart images. We propose a method directly model the relationship between text and clipart images by the co-occurrence relationship between words and visual words, which improves traditional sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR), provides a baseline performance and obtains more relevant results in the condition that all images in database do not have any text tag.

Nowadays, with the boom of electronic devices, there is an increasing need to digitize old classic cartoons as a basis for further editing, including deformation, colorization, etc. To perform such editing, it is essential to extract the structure lines within cartoon images. Traditional edge detection methods are mainly based on gradients. These methods perform poorly in the face of compression artifacts and spatially-varying line colors, which cause gradient values to become unreliable. This paper presents the first approach to extract structure lines in cartoons based on regions. Our method starts by segmenting an image into regions, and then classifies them as edge regions and non-edge regions. Our second main contribution comprises three measures to estimate the likelihood of a region being a non-edge region. These measure darkness, local contrast, and shape. Since the likelihoods become unreliable as regions become smaller, we further classify regions using both likelihoods and the relationships to neighboring regions via a graph-cut formulation. Our method has been evaluated on a wide variety of cartoon images, and convincing results are obtained in all cases."

Object detection using shape is interesting since it is well known that humans can recognize an object simply from its shape. Thus, shape-based methods have great promise to handle a large amount of shape variation using a compact representation. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for object detection that uses a single reasonably good sketch as a reference to build a model for the object. The method hierarchically segments a given sketch into parts using an automatic algorithm and estimates a different affine transformation for each part while matching. A Hough-style voting scheme collects evidence for the object from the leaves to the root in the part decomposition tree for robust detection. Missing edge segments, clutter and generic object deformations are handled by flexibly following the contour paths in the edge image that resemble the model contours. Efficient data-structures and a two-stage matching approach assist in yielding an efficient and robust system. Results on ETHZ and several other popular image datasets yield promising results compared to the state-of-the-art. A new dataset of real-life hand-drawn sketches for all the object categories in the ETHZ dataset is also used for evaluation."

In this work, we study how to build effective representations for sketch recognition. First, to capture saliency patterns of different scales and spatial arrangements, a Gabor-based low-level representation is proposed. Then, based on this representation, to discovery more complex patterns in a sketch, a Hybrid Multilayer Sparse Coding (HMSC) model is proposed to learn mid-level representations. An improved dictionary learning algorithm is also leveraged in HMSC to reduce over-fitting to common but trivial patterns. Extensive experiments show that the proposed representations are highly discriminative and lead to large improvements over the state of the arts."

One of the main challenges in sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is to measure the similarity between a sketch and an image in contour with high precision. To tackle this problem, we divided the contour of image into two types: the first is global contour, suggesting that we can use it to reduce the similarity between the images with complex background. The second, called salient contour, is helpful to retrieve images with objects similar to the query. Besides, we propose a new descriptor, namely angular radial orientation partitioning (AROP) feature, which makes full use of the gradient orientation information to decrease the gap between sketch and image. Using the two contours as candidate contours for feature extraction could increase the retrieval rate dramatically. Finally an application of retrieval system based on this algorithm is established. The experiment on 0.42 million image dataset shows excellent retrieval performance of the proposed method and comparisons with other algorithms are also given."

While many methods exist for sketch-based object detection/image retrieval on small datasets, relatively less work has been done on large (web)-scale image retrieval. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for image retrieval from millions of images based on user-drawn sketches. Unlike existing methods for this problem which are sensitive to even translation or scale variations, our method handles rotation, translation, scale (i.e. a similarity transformation) and small deformations. The object boundaries are represented as chains of connected segments and the database images are pre-processed to obtain such chains that have a high chance of containing the object. This is accomplished using two approaches in this work: a) extracting long chains in contour segment networks and b) extracting boundaries of segmented object proposals. These chains are then represented by similarity-invariant variable length descriptors. Descriptor similarities are computed by a fast Dynamic Programming-based partial matching algorithm. This matching mechanism is used to generate a hierarchical k-medoids based indexing structure for the extracted chains of all database images in an offline process which is used to efficiently retrieve a small set of possible matched images for query chains. Finally, a geometric verification step is employed to test geometric consistency of multiple chain matches to improve results. Qualitative and quantitative results clearly demonstrate superiority of the approach over existing methods."

The problem is formulated using Mixed Integer Programming, which optimizes over both the local fitness of the selected components and the global plausibility of the connected structure. Evaluations show that our algorithm is significantly better than the straightforward approaches based on direct retrieval or part assembly, and can effectively handle challenging variations in the sketch."

This proposal exploits the advantages provided by the HELO descriptor for describing sketches, and improves significantly its performance by using a soft computation of local orientations and taking into account spatial information. We experimentally demonstrate that a soft computation process together with a local estimation of orientations are very suitable for describing sketches in the context of image retrieval. Indeed, our results show that S-HELO significantly outperforms not only HELO but also classical orientation-based descriptors as HOG. We also show that S-HELO performs very close to the optimal when what we want to retrieve are target images. Moreover, our proposal also shows an outstanding performance for similarity search, i.e., retrieving images that belong to the same category of the query sketch."

The effect of the yield criterion on the numerical results is analysed using three yield functions, von Mises, Hill’48 and Barlat Yld’91, combined with the Swift hardening law. The anisotropy parameters of the Hill’48 model are identified using either the yield stresses or r-values, obtained from the uniaxial tensile test at three different directions. On the other hand, the anisotropy parameters of the Yld’91 are determined taking into account both the yield stresses and r-values, minimizing an objective function. The comparison between experimental and numerical results is presented, being the punch force evolution and the thickness distribution along the cup wall the principal variables under study. In both forming stages, the predicted punch force evolution is close to the experimental one, whatever the yield criterion adopted. Nevertheless, the cup wall thickness distribution is strongly influenced by the yield criteria, being clearly overestimated by the von Mises yield criterion. On the other hand, the Yld’91 yield criterion provides a thickness distribution closer to the experimental one, for both forming stages. The strain paths during both forming stages ranges from uniaxial compression, when the material flows between the die and blank-holder, to plane strain in the cup wall, whereas the important strain path changes occurs in the die radius."

The effect of ram speed, drawing ratio, holding time, and temper was also investigated. Among the parameters investigated temperature was found to have the most significant effect on the force-displacement response. Because anisotropy has been an important concern during the deep-drawing process, this parameter was also investigated by looking at the earing profile. With increasing temperature the amplitude of earing decreased while the number of ears remained the same, indicating that there is no change in anisotropy with temperature.

In this paper, we present an efficient approach for image retrieval from millions of images based on user-drawn sketches. Unlike existing methods which are sensitive to even translation or scale variations, our method handles translation, scale, rotation (similarity) and small deformations. To make online retrieval fast, each database image is preprocessed to extract sequences of contour segments (chains) that capture sufficient shape information which are represented by succinct variable length descriptors. Chain similarities are computed by a fast Dynamic Programming-based approximate substring matching algorithm, which enables partial matching of chains. Finally, hierarchical k-medoids based indexing is used for very fast retrieval in a few seconds on databases with millions of images. Qualitative and quantitative results clearly demonstrate superiority of the approach over existing methods."

The first algorithm uses mixed integer programming to optimize a weighted balance between positive and negative class accuracies. Regularization is introduced to improve generalization performance. The second method uses an approximation in order to assist with scalability. Specifically, it follows a \textit{characterize then discriminate} approach, where the positive class is characterized first by boxes, and then each box boundary becomes a separate discriminative classifier. This method has the computational advantages that it can be easily parallelized, and considers only the relevant regions of feature space."

This paper proposes a novel sketch-based 3D model retrieval approach which utilizes both global feature-based and local feature-based techniques. Unlike current approaches which use either global or local features, as well as do not take into account semantic relations between local features, we extract these two kinds of feature information from the representative 2D views of 3D models that can facilitate semantic description and retrieval for 3D models. Global features represent the gross exterior boundary shape information, and local features describe the interior details by compact visual words. Specifically, an improved bag-of-features method is provided to extract local features and their latent semantic relations. In addition, an efficient two-stage matching strategy is used to measure the distance between the query sketch and 3D models for selection and refinement. Experiment results demonstrate that our approach which combines these two kinds of complementary features significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches."

Second, an efficient algorithm is proposed to detect and conceptually remove all distorted zones, retaining reliable line segments only. These line segments are then locally characterized to form a local structure representation of each crossing zone. Finally, a novel optimization algorithm is presented to reconstruct the junctions.

This is a natural and necessary interaction in real systems such as Visio where very similar shapes exist. First, a novel algorithm is proposed to mine the prior shape knowledge for three editing modes. Second, to differentiate visually similar shapes, a novel symbol recognition algorithm is introduced by leveraging the learnt shape knowledge. Then, a novel editing detection algorithm is proposed to facilitate symbol recognition. Furthermore, both of the symbol recognizer and the editing detector are systematically incorporated into the full sketch recognition. Finally, based on the proposed algorithms, a realtime sketch recognition system is built to recognize handdrawn flowcharts and diagrams with flexible interactions.

Such a scenario requires a common representation for the sketch and the images. We propose novel shapebased descriptors that are calculated on local contour fragments. The contour descriptors are stored in a hierarchical data structure, which enables efficient retrieval in sub-linear time, potentially handles millions of images, and does not require retraining when inserting new images. We demonstrate superior performance in this query-by-shape-sketch retrieval for our novel features, and efficient retrieval in 50 milliseconds on a standard single core computer."

This work pertains to making comic books more accessible. Specifically, this paper explains how we detect elements such as speech bubbles present in Japanese comic book panels. Some applications of the work presented in this paper are automatic detection of text and its transformation into audio or into other languages. Automatic detection of elements can also allow reasoning and analysis at a deeper semantic level than what's possible today. Our approach uses an expert system and a machine learning system. The expert system process information from images and inspires feature sets which help train the machine learning system. The expert system detects speech bubbles based on heuristics. The machine learning system uses machine learning algorithms. Specifically, Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and support vector machine are used to detect speech bubbles. The algorithms are trained in a fully-supervised way and a semi-supervised way. Both the expert system and the machine learning system achieved high accuracy. We are able to train the machine learning algorithms to detect speech bubbles just as accurately as the expert system. We also applied the same approach to eye detection of characters in the panels, and are able to detect majority of the eyes but with low precision. However, we are able to improve the performance of our eye detection system significantly by combining the SVM and either the Naive Bayes or the AdaBoost classifiers. v ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This thesis is inspired by Eriq Augustine's original project on the machine translation of Japanese comic books. I would like to thank Eriq for his guidance and assistance on the selection of this thesis topic."

Level or iso-intensity curves are much more stable under such conditions, especially the longer ones. In this paper, we identify stable portions on long iso-curves and detect corners on them. Further, the iso-curve associated with a corner is used to discard portions from the background and improve matching. Such CoMIC (Corners on Maximally-stable Iso-intensity Curves) points yield superior results at the object boundary regions compared to state-of-the-art detectors while performing comparably at the interior regions as well. This is illustrated in exhaustive matching experiments for both boundary and non-boundary regions in applications such as stereo and point tracking for structure from motion in video sequences."

Compared to existing methods, which recognize strokes on a completed drawing, our method captures both spatial and temporal information of the strokes, and faithfully vectorizes them with timestamps. By this, we can avoid various stroke recognition ambiguities, enhance the vectorization quality, and recover the stroke drawing order. This is a challenging problem, requiring robust tracking of pencil tip, accurate modeling of pen-paper contact, handling pen-paper and hand-paper occlusion, while achieving interactive performance. To address these issues, we develop the following novel techniques. First, we perform robust spatio-temporal tracking of pencil tip by extracting discriminable features, which can be classified with a fast cascade of classifiers. Second, we model the pen-paper contact by analyzing the edge-profile of the acquired trajectory and extracting the portions related to individual strokes. Lastly, we propose a spatio-temporal method to reconstruct meaningful strokes, which are coherent to the stroke drawing continuity and drawing order. By integrating these techniques, our method can support interactive recognition and vectorization of drawn strokes that are faithful to the actual strokes drawn by the user, and facilitate the development of various multimedia applications such as video scribing, cartoon production, and pen input interface."

The most important objective in graph drawing is minimization of the number of crossings in the drawing, as the aesthetics and readability of graph drawings depend on the number of edge crossings. VLSI layouts with fewer crossings are more easily realizable and consequently cheaper. A straight-line drawing of a planar graph G of n vertices is a drawing of G such that each edge is drawn as a straight-line segment without edge crossings. However, a problem with current graph layout methods which are capable of producing satisfactory results for a wide range of graphs is that they often put an extremely high demand on computational resources. This paper introduces a new layout method, which nicely draws internally convex of planar graph that consumes only little computational resources and does not need any heavy duty preprocessing. Here, we use two methods: The first is self organizing map known from unsupervised neural networks which is known as (SOM) and the second method is Inverse Self Organized Map (ISOM)."

GF-HOG is shown to consistently outperform retrieval versus SIFT, multi-resolution HOG, Self Similarity, Shape Context and Structure Tensor. Further, we incorporate semantic keywords into our GF-HOG system to enable the use of annotated sketches for image search. A novel graph-based measure of semantic similarity is proposed and two applications explored: semantic sketch based image retrieval and a semantic photo montage."

Recently, many face sketch-photo synthesis methods have been proposed under the framework of inductive learning, and these have obtained promising performance. However, these inductive learning-based face sketch-photo synthesis methods may result in high losses for test samples, because inductive learning minimizes the empirical loss for training samples. This paper presents a novel transductive face sketch-photo synthesis method that incorporates the given test samples into the learning process and optimizes the performance on these test samples. In particular, it defines a probabilistic model to optimize both the reconstruction fidelity of the input photo (sketch) and the synthesis fidelity of the target output sketch (photo), and efficiently optimizes this probabilistic model by alternating optimization. The proposed transductive method significantly reduces the expected high loss and improves the synthesis performance for test samples. Experimental results on the Chinese University of Hong Kong face sketch data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with representative inductive learning-based face sketch-photo synthesis methods."

Sketches used in forensic investigations are either drawn by forensic artists (forensic sketches) or created with computer software (composite sketches) following the verbal description provided by an eyewitness or the victim. These sketches are posted in public places and in media in hopes that some viewers will provide tips about the identity of the suspect. This method of identifying suspects is slow and tedious and may not lead to apprehension of the suspect. Hence, there is a need for a method that can automatically and quickly match facial sketches to large police mugshot databases. We address the problem of automatic facial sketch to mugshot matching and, for the first time, compare the effectiveness of forensic sketches and composite sketches. The contributions of this paper include: (i) a database containing mugshots and corresponding forensic and composite sketches that will be made available to interested researchers; (ii) a comparison of holistic facial representations versus component based representations for sketch to mugshot matching; and (iii) an analysis of the effect of filtering a mugshot gallery using three sources of demographic information (age, gender and race/ethnicity). Our experimental results show that composite sketches are matched with higher accuracy than forensic sketches to the corresponding mugshots.

The problem is nontrivial because of the sparse and abstract nature of hand drawings as compared to photographic images of objects, compounded by a highly variable degree of details in human sketches. To this end, we present a method for the representation and matching of sketches by exploiting not only local features but also global structures of sketches, through a star graph based ensemble matching strategy. Different local feature representations were evaluated using the star graph model to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ensemble matching of structured features. We further show that by encapsulating holistic structure matching and learned bag-of-features models into a single framework, notable recognition performance improvement over the state-of-the-art can be observed.

In this work, we systematically study this problem and try to build a system to support query-by-sketch for two billion images. The raw edge pixel and Chamfer matching are selected as the basic representation and matching in this system, owning to the superior performance compared with other methods in extensive experiments. To get a more compact feature and a faster matching, a vector-like Chamfer feature pair is introduced, based on which the complex matching is reformulated as the crossover dot-product of feature pairs. Based on this new formulation, a compact shape code is developed to represent each image/sketch by projecting the Chamfer features to a linear subspace followed by a non-linear source coding. Finally, the multi-probe Kmedoids-LSH is leveraged to index database images, and the compact shape codes are further used for fast reranking. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed features and algorithms in building such a sketch-based image search system."

Still, retrieval accuracies of previous algorithms remained low, as sets of features, one of sketches and the other of rendered images of 3D models, are quite different, they are said to lie in different domains. A previous approach used semantic labels to establish correspondence between features across inter-domain gap. This approach, however, is prone to over learning if dataset is difficult to learn, i.e., if labeling is sparse and/or if only a small subset of each class is labeled. This paper proposes Cross-Domain Manifold Ranking (CDMR), an algorithm that effectively compares two sets of features that lie in different domains. The proposed algorithm first establishes feature subspace, or manifold, separately in each of the domains. Then, the two feature manifolds are interrelated to form a unified Cross-Domain Manifold (CDM) by using both feature similarity and semantic label correspondence across the domains. Given a query sketch, similarity ranks of 3D models are computed by diffusing relevance value from the sketch over the CDM. Experimental evaluation by using sketch-based 3D model retrieval benchmarks showed that the CDMR is more accurate than state-of-the-art sketch-based 3D model retrieval algorithms."

To copy manga, illegal users generally focus on certain interesting parts from which to make partial copies to apply in their own drawings. With respect to their sources, copying of manga can be divided into two types: (1) exact copies, which duplicate specific contents of manga, such as scanned manga publications (printed copies) and traced outlines of manga (hand-drawn copies), and (2) similar partial copies, which infringe the copyright of manga characters based on their features. In this paper, we propose applying content-based image retrieval methods to detect both exact and similar copies based on two kinds of regions of interest (ROIs): generic ROIs and face ROIs. The method is able not only to locate the partial copies from images with complex backgrounds, but also to report the corresponding copied parts of copyrighted manga pages for exact copy detection and copied manga characters for similar copy detection. The experimental results prove high performance of the proposed method for detecting printed partial copies. In addition, 85 % of hand-drawn and 77 % of similar partial copies were detected with relatively high precision using a database containing more than $$10{,}000$$ manga pages."

Specifically, this algorithm formulate cartoon matching as a many-to-many labeling problem. To refine the results of matching, an optimization approach is adopted to alternatively conduct the MAP estimation and the ML estimation.

The main idea is that the same character will be repre- sented by similar subgraphs in the different panels where it appears. The two-step matching process consists in a node matching step and an edge validation step.

Within this, forming of cylindrical cup is one of the most widely studied deep drawing processes since it allows analysing the effect of different process parameters in phenomena such as earing, springback and ironing. In fact, during the deep drawing of a cylindrical cup the blank thickness gradually increases as the blank outer diameter is reduced to the die inner diameter, resulting in a thickness increase from a point near the bottom radius until the maximum value at the top of the cup. Therefore, if the gap between the punch and the die is not sufficiently large to allow the blank material to flow, ironing of the cup wall will occur. The ironing process typically imposes high contact forces, normal to the surface of the punch and the die, which can lead to the occurrence of galling, particularly for aluminium alloys. In this work an experimental device, adopted in previous studies, was used to analyse the influence of the lubricant conditions in the deep drawing of a cylindrical cup. The study considers an AA5754-O aluminium alloy blank with a diameter of 60 mm, which is fully deep drawn with a 33 mm diameter punch. Due to the forming conditions, the cup is deep drawn and ironing of the cup wall also occurs. The experimental tests were performed considering different amounts of lubricant in the blank surfaces in the contact with the die and with the blank-holder in order to better understand the influence of these tools on the process. The experimental study was complemented with numerical simulations, exploring the conditions induced by the ironing operation, quite challenging for the numerical simulation of the process using the finite element method. Besides the influence of the contact with friction conditions in the forming process (i.e. punch force evolution, thickness distribution along the cup wall and contact pressure), the influence of the die shoulder and inner radius were also analysed."

Under SCDL, a pair of dictionaries and a mapping function will be simultaneously learned. The dictionary pair can well characterize the structural domains of the two styles of images, while the mapping function can reveal the intrinsic relationship between the two styles' domains. In SCDL, the two dictionaries will not be fully coupled, and hence much flexibility can be given to the mapping function for an accurate conversion across styles. Moreover, clustering and image nonlocal redundancy are introduced to enhance the robustness of SCDL.

To successfully achieve these tasks, it is essential to extract visual features that comprehensively represent cartoon characters and to construct an accurate distance metric to precisely measure the dissimilarities between cartoon characters. In this paper, we introduce three visual features, color histogram, shape context, and skeleton, to characterize the color, shape, and action, respectively, of a cartoon character. These three features are complementary to each other, and each feature set is regarded as a single view. However, it is improper to concatenate these three features into a long vector, because they have different physical properties, and simply concatenating them into a high-dimensional feature vector will suffer from the so-called curse of dimensionality. Hence, we propose a semisupervised multiview distance metric learning (SSM-DML). SSM-DML learns the multiview distance metrics from multiple feature sets and from the labels of unlabeled cartoon characters simultaneously, under the umbrella of graph-based semisupervised learning. SSM-DML discovers complementary characteristics of different feature sets through an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm. Therefore, SSM-DML can simultaneously accomplish cartoon character classification and dissimilarity measurement. On the basis of SSM-DML, we develop a novel system that composes the modules of multiview cartoon character classification, multiview graph-based cartoon synthesis, and multiview retrieval-based cartoon synthesis. Experimental evaluations based on the three modules suggest the effectiveness of SSM-DML in cartoon applications."

SNS can find closely related neighbors adaptively and then generate an initial estimate for the pseudoimage. In SRE, a coupled sparse representation model is first constructed to learn the mapping between sketch patches and photo patches, and a patch-derivative-based sparse representation method is subsequently applied to enhance the quality of the synthesized photos and sketches. Finally, four retrieval modes, namely, sketch-based, photo-based, pseudosketch-based, and pseudophoto-based retrieval are proposed, and a retrieval algorithm is developed by using sparse representation.

In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Weight Fields (MWF) model that is capable of synthesizing new sketch patches.

Or how to synthesize new cartoon clips smoothly and efficiently from the cartoon library? Both questions are important for animators and cartoon enthusiasts to design and create new cartoons by utilizing existing cartoon materials. The first key issue to answer those questions is to find a proper representation that describes the cartoon character effectively. In this paper, we consider multiple features from different views, i.e., color histogram, Hausdorff edge feature, and skeleton feature, to represent cartoon characters with different colors, shapes, and gestures. Each visual feature reflects a unique characteristic of a cartoon character, and they are complementary to each other for retrieval and synthesis. However, how to combine the three visual features is the second key issue of our application. By simply concatenating them into a long vector, it will end up with the so-called “curse of dimensionality,” let alone their heterogeneity embedded in different visual feature spaces. Here, we introduce a semisupervised multiview subspace learning (semi-MSL) algorithm, to encode different features in a unified space. Specifically, under the patch alignment framework, semi-MSL uses the discriminative information from labeled cartoon characters in the construction of local patches where the manifold structure revealed by unlabeled cartoon characters is utilized to capture the geometric distribution. The experimental evaluations based on both cartoon character retrieval and clip synthesis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for cartoon application. Moreover, additional results of content-based image retrieval on benchmark data suggest the generality of semi-MSL for other applications."

We find, in common with many other studies, that removing edge crossings is the most significant aesthetic, but also discover that aligning nodes and edges to an underlying grid is important. We observe that the aesthetics favored by participants during creation of a graph drawing are often not evident in the final product and that the participants did not make a clear distinction between the processes of creation and layout.

One of the main challenges in image retrieval is to localize a region in an image which would be matched with the query image in contour. To tackle this problem, we use the human perception mechanism to identify two types of regions in one image: the first type of region (the main region) is defined by a weighted center of image features, suggesting that we could retrieve objects in images regardless of their sizes and positions. The second type of region, called region of interests (ROI), is to find the most salient part of an image, and is helpful to retrieve images with objects similar to the query in a complicated scene. So using the two types of regions as candidate regions for feature extraction, our algorithm could increase the retrieval rate dramatically. Besides, to accelerate the retrieval speed, we first extract orientation features and then organize them in a hierarchal way to generate global-to-local features. Based on this characteristic, a hierarchical database index structure could be built which makes it possible to retrieve images on a very large scale image database online. Finally a real-time image retrieval system on 4.5 million database is developed to verify the proposed algorithm.

However, few researches have been done in order to analyse the content of comics such as panels, speech balloons or characters. At first glance, the structure of a comic page may appear easy to determine. In practice, the configuration of the page, the size and the shape of the panels can be different from one page to the next. Moreover, authors often draw extended contents (speech balloon or comic art) that overlap two panels or more. In some situations, the panel extraction can become a real challenge. Speech balloons are other important elements of comics. Full text indexing is only possible if the text can be extracted. However the text is usually embedded among graphic elements. Moreover, unlike newspapers, the text layout in speech balloons can be irregular. Classic text extraction method can fail. We propose, in this paper, a method based on region growing and mathematical morphology to extract automatically the panels of a comic page and a method to detect speech balloons. Our approach is compared with other methods find in the literature. Results are presented and discussed."

First, a graph-based sketch segmentation algorithm is proposed to segment a cluttered sketch into multiple parts based on the factor of proximity. Then, to improve the ability of detecting semantically meaningful objects, a semantic-based approach is introduced to simulate the past experience in the perceptual system by leveraging a web-scale clipart database. Finally, other important factors learnt from past experience, such as similarity, symmetry, direction, and closure, are also taken into account to make the approach more robust and practical. The proposed sketch segmentation framework has ability to handle complex sketches with overlapped objects.

In this paper, a sketch-based retrieval algorithm is proposed based on a 3D model feature named View Context and 2D relative shape context matching. To enhance the accuracy of 2D sketch-3D model correspondence as well as the retrieval performance, we propose to align a 3D model with a query 2D sketch before measuring their distance. First, we efficiently select some candidate views from a set of densely sampled views of the 3D model to align the sketch and the model based on their View Context similarities. Then, we compute the more accurate relative shape context distance between the sketch and every candidate view, and regard the minimum one as the sketch-model distance. To speed up retrieval, we precompute the View Context and relative shape context features of the sample views of all the 3D models in the database. Comparative and evaluative experiments based on hand-drawn and standard line drawing sketches demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach and it significantly outperforms several latest sketch-based retrieval algorithms."

In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically generate a stylistic manga layout from a set of input artworks with user-specified semantics, thus allowing less-experienced users to create high-quality manga layouts with minimal efforts. We first introduce three parametric style models that encode the unique stylistic aspects of manga layouts, including layout structure, panel importance, and panel shape. Next, we propose a two-stage approach to generate a manga layout: 1) an initial layout is created that best fits the input artworks and layout structure model, according to a generative probabilistic framework; 2) the layout and artwork geometries are jointly refined using an efficient optimization procedure, resulting in a professional-looking manga layout. Through a user study, we demonstrate that our approach enables novice users to easily and quickly produce higher-quality layouts that exhibit realistic manga styles, when compared to a commercially-available manual layout tool."

LRBP is inspired by the fact that the shape of a face photo and its corresponding sketch is similar, even when the sketch is exaggerated by an artist. Therefore, the shape of face can be exploited to compute features which are robust against modality differences between face photo and sketch. In LRBP framework, the characteristics of face shape are captured by transforming face image into Radon space. Then, micro-information of face shape in new space is encoded by Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Finally, LRBP is computed by concatenating histograms of local LBPs. In order to capture both local and global characteristics of face shape, LRBP is extracted in a spatial pyramid fashion. Experiments on CUFS and CUFSF datasets indicate the efficiency of LRBP for face sketch recognition."

Then these high-dimensional DT features are further projected to more compact binary hash bits. The experimental results show that our method achieves very competitive retrieval performance with MindFinder approach [3] but only requires much less memory storage (e.g., our method only requires 3% of total memory storage of MindFinder in 2.1 million images). Due to its low consumption of memory, the whole system can independently operate on the mobile devices."

To increase the recognition coverage, a web-scale clipart image collection is leveraged as the knowledge base of the recognition system. To alleviate the problems of intra-class shape variation and inter-class shape ambiguity in this unconstrained situation, a query-adaptive shape topic model is proposed to mine object topics and shape topics related to the sketch, in which, multiple layers of information such as sketch, object, shape, image, and semantic labels are modeled in a generative process. Besides sketch recognition, the proposed topic model can also be used for related applications such as sketch tagging, image tagging, and sketch-based image search.

Since crisp black line artwork and lettering are the most important structural and stylistic elements in this important genre of color illustrations, our digitization process is geared towards faithful reconstruction of these elements. This is a challenging task, because commercial presses perform halftoning (screening) to approximate continuous tones and colors with overlapping grids of dots. Although a large number of inverse haftoning (descreening) methods exist, they typically blur the intricate black artwork. Our approach is specifically designed to descreen color comics, which typically reproduce color using screened CMY inks, but print the black artwork using non-screened solid black ink. After separating the scanned image into three screening grids, one for each of the CMY process inks, we use non-linear optimization to fit a parametric model describing each grid, and simultaneously recover the non-screened black ink layer, which is then vectorized. The result of this process is a high quality, compact, and rescalable digital representation of the original artwork."

In this work, we present a new keyshape based approach named HKO-KASD for retrieving 3D models using rough sketches as queries. Our approach comprises two general steps. First, a global descriptor is used to determine the appropriate viewpoint for each model. Second, we apply a local matching process to determine the final ranking for an input sketch. To this end, we present a local descriptor capable of working with sketch representations. The global descriptors as well as the local descriptors rely on a set of keyshapes precomputed from 2D representations of 3D models and from the query sketch as well.

In this system, first the facial features/components from training images are extracted, then ratios of length, width, and area etc. are calculated and those are stored as feature vectors for individual images. After that the mean feature vectors are computed and subtracted from each feature vector for centering of the feature vectors. In the next phase, feature vector for the incoming probe face-sketch is also computed in similar fashion. Here, K-NN classifier is used to recognize probe face-sketch. It is experimentally verified that the proposed method is robust against faces are in a frontal pose, with normal lighting and neutral expression and have no occlusions.

Recently there has been a growing interest in sketch recognition technologies for facilitating human-computer interaction in a variety of settings, including design, art, and teaching. Automatic sketch recognition is a challenging problem due to the variability in hand drawings, the variation in the order of strokes, and the similarity of symbol classes. In this paper, we focus on a more difficult task, namely the task of classifying sketched symbols before they are fully completed. There are two main challenges in recognizing partially drawn symbols. The first is deciding when a partial drawing contains sufficient information for recognizing it unambiguously among other visually similar classes in the domain. The second challenge is classifying the partial drawings correctly with this partial information. We describe a sketch auto-completion framework that addresses these challenges by learning visual appearances of partial drawings through semi-supervised clustering, followed by a supervised classification step that determines object classes. Our evaluation results show that, despite the inherent ambiguity in classifying partially drawn symbols, we achieve promising auto-completion accuracies for partial drawings. Furthermore, our results for full symbols match/surpass existing methods on full object recognition accuracies reported in the literature. Finally, our design allows real-time symbol classification, making our system applicable in real world applications."

Then, a series of overlapped photo patches can be synthesized on the basis of the learned coupled dictionary. Afterwards, these overlapped photo patches are further selected by the proposed global energy minimization framework based on a Markov network. Finally, a multi-band blending process is carried out to synthesize a realistic face photo.

The intra-correlation considered in this study makes the comparison with other features within the same input image, and has the effect of exaggerating the major facial features while simultaneously subduing the visual impact of non-major facial features. The NPR module consists of a black-and-white sketch creation process and a colored facial cartoon creation process.

Using some researches we deduce that the majority of automatic sign language translation systems ignore many aspects when they generate animation; therefore the interpretation lost the truth information meaning. Our goals are: to translate written text from any language to ASL animation; to model maximum raw information using machine learning and computational techniques; and to produce a more adapted and expressive form to natural looking and understandable ASL animations. Our methods include linguistic annotation of initial text and semantic orientation to generate the facial expression. We use the genetic algorithms coupled to learning/recognized systems to produce the most natural form. To detect emotion we are based on fuzzy logic to produce the degree of interpolation between facial expressions. Roughly, we present a new expressive language Text Adapted Sign Modeling Language TASML that describes all maximum aspects related to a natural sign language interpretation. This paper is organized as follow: the next section is devoted to present the comprehension effect of using Space/Time/SVO form in ASL animation based on experimentation. In section 3, we describe our technical considerations. We present the general approach we adopted to develop our tool in section 4. Finally, we give some perspectives and future works."

Although great progress has been made, previous methods only work on face sketches with rich textures which are not easily to obtain. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm for synthesizing a face photo from a simple line drawing that contains only a few lines without any texture. In order to obtain a robust result, firstly, the input sketch is divided into several patches and edge descriptors are extracted from these local input patches. Afterwards, an MRF framework is built based on the divided local patches. Then a series of candidate photo patches are synthesized for each local sketch patch based on a coupled dictionary learned from a set of training data. Finally, the MRF is optimized to get the final estimated photo patches for each input sketch patch and a realistic face photo is synthesized. Experimental results on CUHK database have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, most existing approaches use a grayscale edge detector for line extraction, so that only luminance differences between nearby image pixels is taken into account, but the chrominance differences is ignored. This leads to the undesirable consequence that visually significant edges in adjacent regions with different colors of similar luminance cannot be detected. To address this limitation, we present a novel enhanced line drawing method based on a flow-based difference-of-Gaussians (FDoG) filter. Because of an inherent property of the thresholded DoG edge model, captured lines may appear dislodged from the true edges in the image. To this end, we provide a gradient-guided warping technique so that smooth and coherent lines can be extracted in the correct location. The GPU implementation of the proposed algorithms allows real-time performance, and experimental examples with various color images demonstrate the method’s superior qualitative performance over previous approaches."

Children usually explore the world around them through intellectual, physical and emotional methods for young children; pencil, brush and paper are the best means of conveying their fondest hopes and most profound fears. The progression of drawings that children make over a period of time can show significant growth and development, as well as determine academic capabilities and skills characteristic of their developmental level (Brittain & Lowenfeld, 1987). According to Lowenfeld, children begin their drawing process as early as they can physically hold a drawing utensil. From their first attempts at a drawing, consisting of random marks and lines, to their first representational drawing, children are making efforts to communicate to the world around them and establish meaning through the images they create (Brittain & Lowenfeld, 1987).

Our robust shape matching, however, requires dense sampling and registration and incurs a high computational cost. We thus devise critical acceleration methods to achieve interactive performance: precomputing kNN graphs that record transformations between neighboring contour images and enable fast online shape alignment; pruning sampling and shape registration strategically and hierarchically; and parallelizing shape matching on multi‐core platforms or GPUs.

Some available popular synthesis methods, like locally linear embedding (LLE), usually generate sketches or photos with lower definition and blurred details, which reduces the visual quality and the recognition rate across the heterogeneous images. In order to improve the quality of the synthesized images, a multi-dictionary sparse representation based face sketch-photo synthesis model is constructed. In the proposed model, LLE is used to estimate an initial sketch or photo, while the multi-dictionary sparse representation model is applied to generate the high frequency and detail information. Finally, by linear superimposing, the enhanced face sketch or photo can be obtained. Experimental results show that sketches and photos synthesized by the proposed method have higher definition and much richer detail information resulting in a higher face recognition rate between sketches and photos."

Sketch-based user interfaces aim to combine the expressive power of free-hand sketching with the processing power of computers. Most sketch-based systems require intelligent ink processing capabilities, which makes the development of robust sketch recognition algorithms a primary concern in the field. So far, the research in sketch recognition has produced various independent approaches to recognition, each of which uses a particular kind of information (e.g., geometric and spatial constraints, image-based features, temporal stroke-ordering patterns). These methods were designed in isolation as stand-alone algorithms, and there has been little work treating various recognition methods as alternative sources of information that can be combined to increase sketch recognition accuracy. In this paper, we focus on two such methods and fuse an image-based method with a time-based method in an attempt to combine the knowledge of how objects look (image data) with the knowledge of how they are drawn (temporal data). In the course of combining spatial and temporal information, we also introduce a mathematically well founded fusion method for combining recognizers. Our combination method can be used for isolated sketch recognition as well as full diagram recognition. Our evaluation with two databases shows that fusing image-based and temporal features yields higher recognition rates. These results are the first to confirm the complementary nature of image-based and temporal recognition methods for full sketch recognition, which has long been suggested, but never supported by data."

We present a structure-based local approach (STELA) for retrieving 3D models using a rough sketch as query. It consists of four steps: get an abstract image, detect keyshapes, compute a local descriptor, and match local descriptors. We represent a 3D model by means of suggestive contours. Our proposal includes an additional step aiming at reducing the number of models that will be compared by our local approach.

In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatic generation of digital caricatures from facial photographs, which capture artistic deformation styles from hand-drawn caricatures. We introduced a pseudo stress-strain model to encode the parameters of an artistic deformation style using “virtual” physical and material properties. We have also developed a software system for performing the caricaturistic deformation in 3D which eliminates the undesirable artifacts in 2D caricaturization. We employed a Multilevel Free-Form Deformation (MFFD) technique to optimize a 3D head model reconstructed from an input facial photograph, and for controlling the caricaturistic deformation. Our results demonstrated the effectiveness and usability of the proposed approach, which allows ordinary users to apply the captured and stored deformation styles to a variety of facial photographs."

The guided synthesis is defined as a local linear model, which generates a cartoon image by incorporating the content of guidance images taken from the training set. Our synthesis operation is achieved based on four weight functions. The first is a photo-photo weight that aims to measure the similarity between an input photo patch and a training photo patch. The second is defined as a photo-cartoon weight, which is used to compute the likelihood by computing the similarity between a cartoon patch and an input photo patch. The third weight is defined in the synthesized photos, which is to set a smoothness constraint between neighboring synthesized patches. The final weight is designed to evaluate the similarity of a synthesized patch to an input patch based on the spatial distance. Experimental evaluation on a number of face photos demonstrates the good performance of the proposed method on the face cartoon synthesis."

By applying this relationship to the input face photo patch, we can infer the output face sketch patch by exploiting some regression techniques such as kNN, the Lasso and so on. Via our local regression model, we can synthesize an appealing sketch portrait from a given face photo in a few minutes.

During the process of sketches extraction, saliency maps are used to filter out the redundant background information, while preserve the important semantic information. We use a variant of Words-of-Interest model to retrieve relevant images for the user according to the query. Words-of-Interest (WoI) model is based on Bag-ofvisual Words (BoW) model, which has been proven successfully for information retrieval. Bag-of-Words ignores the spatial relationships among visual words, which are important for sketch representation.

Among various styles of tree drawings reported in the literature, the balloon drawing enjoys a desirable feature of displaying tree structures in a rather balanced fashion. For each internal node in a balloon drawing, the ray from the node to each of its children divides the wedge accommodating the subtree rooted at the child into two sub-wedges. Depending on whether the two sub-wedge angles are required to be identical or not, a balloon drawing can further be divided into two types: even sub-wedge and uneven sub-wedge types. In the most general case, for any internal node in the tree there are two dimensions of freedom that affect the quality of a balloon drawing: (1) altering the order in which the children of the node appear in the drawing, and (2) for the subtree rooted at each child of the node, flipping the two sub-wedges of the subtree. In this paper, we give a comprehensive complexity analysis for optimizing balloon drawings of rooted trees with respect to angular resolution, aspect ratio and standard deviation of angles under various drawing cases depending on whether the tree is of even or uneven sub-wedge type and whether (1) and (2) above are allowed. It turns out that some are NP-complete while others can be solved in polynomial time. We also derive approximation algorithms for those that are intractable in general."

Although great progress has been made in recent years, previous methods only work under well controlled conditions and often fail when there are variations of lighting and pose. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm for synthesizing a face sketch from a face photo taken under a different lighting condition and in a different pose than the training set. It synthesizes local sketch patches using a multiscale Markov Random Field (MRF) model. The robustness to lighting and pose variations is achieved in three steps. Firstly, shape priors specific to facial components are introduced to reduce artifacts and distortions caused by variations of lighting and pose. Secondly, new patch descriptors and metrics which are more robust to lighting variations are used to find candidates of sketch patches given a photo patch. Lastly, a smoothing term measuring both intensity compatibility and gradient compatibility is used to match neighboring sketch patches on the MRF network more effectively. The proposed approach significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art method. Its effectiveness is shown through experiments on the CUHK face sketch database and celebrity photos collected from the web."

Novel sketch recognition algorithms were developed to use the information provided by the face recognition to evaluate the hand-drawn face. Two design iterations and user studies led to nine design principles for providing such instruction, presenting reference media, giving corrective feedback, and receiving actions from the user. The result is a proof-of-concept application that can guide a person through step-by-step instruction and generated feedback toward producing his/her own sketch of a human face in a reference image."

Compared to flowing cloth, such as loose dresses or capes, these types of garments involve nearly continuous collision contact and small wrinkles, that can be troublesome for traditional cloth simulation methods. Based on the observation that the wrinkles in close-fitting clothing behave in a predominantly kinematic fashion, we have developed an example-based wrinkle synthesis technique. Our method drives wrinkle generation from the pose of the figure's kinematic skeleton. This approach allows high quality clothing wrinkles to be combined with a coarse cloth simulation that computes the global and dynamic aspects of the clothing motion. While the combined results do not exactly match a high-resolution reference simulation, they do capture many of the characteristic fine-scale features and wrinkles. Further, the combined system runs at interactive rates, making it suitable for applications where high-resolution offline simulations would not be a viable option. The wrinkle synthesis method uses a precomputed database built by simulating the high-resolution clothing as the articulated figure is moved over a range of poses. In principle, the space of poses is exponential in the total number of degrees of freedom; however clothing wrinkles are primarily affected by the nearest joints, allowing each joint to be processed independently. During synthesis, mesh interpolation is used to consider the influence of multiple joints, and combined with a coarse simulation to produce the final results at interactive rates."

In this paper, we describe a method based on computing efficiently a histogram of edge local orientations that we call HELO. Our method is based on a strategy applied in the context of fingerprint processing. This descriptor is invariant to scale and translation transformations.

Sparse representations are desired in sketch synthesis due to that sparseness can adaptively selects the most relevant samples which give best representations of the input photo.

The forming process consists in drawing a circular blank into a cylindrical cup in two stages, firstly in one direction and then in the opposite one. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the process were performed using the Hill’s 1948 yield criterion associated with three different hardening laws: a purely isotropic hardening, a mixed hardening with both isotropic and non-linear kinematic contributions and a dislocation-based hardening model, which takes into account transient behaviors recorded during strain path changes. The experimental setup is presented as well as results obtained with a mild steel. Numerical simulation results obtained with the three hardening models are compared with experimental ones.

In line with the rapid development of mobile devices, reading comic in small screen mobile devices is also demanded and required. The challenge in providing e-comics for small screen is how to separate comic scene frames and display it in the right order to read. We propose Automatic E-Comic Frame Extraction (ACFE) for extraction of scene frames from a digital comic page automatically. ACFE is based on the blob extraction method using connected component labeling algorithm, together with a filter combination pre-processing and efficient method for detection of line between frames. Experimental results show that 91.483 percent of 634 pages in 5 digital comics are successfully extracted into scene frames by the proposed method."

Computer Generated Caricature is developed in order to assist the user in producing caricature automatically or semi-automatically. It is derived from the rapid advance in computer graphics and computer vision and introduced as a part of computer graphics’ non-photo realistic rendering technologies as well. Recently, Computer Generated Caricature becomes particularly interesting research topic due to the advantageous features of privacy, security, simplification, amusement and their explosive emergent real-world application such as in magazine, digital entertainment, Internet and mobile application. On the basis of the previous facts, this paper surveys the uses of caricature in variety of applications, theories and rules in the art of drawing caricature, how these theories are simulated in the development of caricature generation system and the current research trend in this field. Computer generated caricature can be divided into two main categories based on their input data type: human centered approach and image processing approach. Next, process of generating caricature from input photo is explained briefly. It also reported the state of the art techniques in generating caricature by classifying it into four approaches: interactive, regularity-based, learning-based and predefined database of caricature illustration. Lastly, this paper will discuss relevant issues, problems and several promising direction of future research."

When the facial sketches are to be synthesized in the unique sketching style of a particular artist, the problem becomes even more complex. To resolve these problems, this paper develops an automatic facial sketch synthesis system based on a novel direct combined model (DCM) algorithm. The proposed system executes three cascaded procedures, namely, (1) synthesis of the facial shape from the input texture information (i.e., the facial image); (2) synthesis of the exaggerated facial shape from the synthesized facial shape; and (3) synthesis of a sketch from the original input image and the synthesized exaggerated shape. Previous proposals for reconstructing facial shapes and synthesizing the corresponding facial sketches are heavily reliant on the quality of the texture reconstruction results, which, in turn, are highly sensitive to occlusion and lighting effects in the input image. However, the DCM approach proposed in this paper accurately reconstructs the facial shape and then produces lifelike synthesized facial sketches without the need to recover occluded feature points or to restore the texture information lost as a result of unfavorable lighting conditions. Moreover, the DCM approach is capable of synthesizing facial sketches from input images with a wide variety of facial poses, gaze directions, and facial expressions even when such images are not included within the original training data set."

Models are often insufficiently annotated such that a keyword based search is not promising. Our approach for content based searching of 3D models relies entirely on visual analysis and is based on the observation that a large part of our perception of shapes stems from their salient features, usually captured by dominant lines in their display. Recent research on such feature lines has shown that 1) people mostly draw the same lines when asked to depict a certain model and 2) the shape of an object is well represented by the set of feature lines generated by recent NPR line drawing algorithms [Cole et al. 2009]. Consequently, we suggest an image based approach for 3D shape retrieval, exploiting the similarity of human sketches and the results of current line drawing algorithms. Our search engine takes a sketch of the desired model drawn by a user as the input and compares this sketch to a set of line drawings automatically generated for each of the models in the collection."

Comic consists of many frames that have text, character and illustrations. Moreover, the reading order of comic is defined by frames. Therefore, in order to provide user centric presentation functions for various types of digital devices, and facilitate the developments of other high level contents application i.e. auto text extraction, copyright protection system and so on, accurate frame shape extraction is needed. There are many types of document analysis methods which utilized for general documents. For example utilizing histograms, connected components, density of pixels and so on are proposed [1-3]. However, comics have characteristics, which are different from other general document. For instance, unlike regular document structure, comics have free arrangement where some content protrusion from the frame borders is allowable. Some comic frame separation methods have been proposed. Tanaka et al. have proposed a comic segmentation method by iterative separation [4]. We have extended this iterative separation method utilizing consistency of density gradient, and proposed frame corner detection method [5-6]. However, most of results by frame separation method have redundant blanks. Moreover, results of frame corner detection cannot be used alone for determining frame shapes. In this paper, we propose a frame position detection method that utilizes the result of frame separation and frame corner detection for comic images."

We show how these confidence values equate to user perception, how they can be used to balance speed and accuracy in recognition algorithms, and how they can be used to assign confidence values to the high-level shapes they are used to construct. We use these constraints to extend the LADDER shape definition language in a system that recognizes 5,900 hand-drawn examples of 485 different military course-of-action diagrams at an accuracy of 89.9%."

This paper puts forward a novel method for automatically generating a pencil sketch from a real 2D color image in non-photo-realistic rendering. First of all, the edge of the color image is detected by Sobel operator. Secondly, the color image is sharpened by Unsharp Mask (USM), then color scaling is used to get an image with radial and edge details. Furthermore, the original image is divided into many meaningful regions using an efficient method of image segmentation, then the texture direction is determined by Fourier transform and shape feature. To render better effects of illumination and local texture of pencil sketch, the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) algorithm is applied and combined color scaling and white noise image. At last, the pencil sketch is created and the generation results from the superposition of the edge, the USM image and the texture. The experimental results prove that our approach could efficiently generate more obvious edge, more natural tone and more real texture than existed methods."

To do this, we have to properly extract unique/specialized features of a person's face. A person's facial feature not only depends on his/her natural appearance, but also the associated expression style. Therefore, we would like to extract the neutural facial features and personal expression style for different applicaions. In this paper, we represent the 3D neutral face models in BU–3DFE database by sparse signal decomposition in the training phase. With this decomposition, the sparse training data can be used for robust linear subspace modeling of public faces. For an input 3D face model, we fit the model and decompose the 3D model geometry into a neutral face and the expression deformation separately. The neutral geomertry can be further decomposed into public face and individualized facial feature. We exaggerate the facial features and the expressions by estimating the probability on the corresponding manifold. The public face, the exaggerated facial features and the exaggerated expression are combined to synthesize a 3D caricature for a 3D face model. The proposed algorithm is automatic and can effectively extract the individualized facial features from an input 3D face model to create 3D face caricature."

Complex systems (like large databases or networks) that have a graph structure should be properly visualized in order to avoid obfuscation. One way to provide an aesthetic improvement to a graph visualization is to apply a force-directed drawing algorithm to it. This method, that emerged in the 60's views graphs as spring systems that exert forces (repulsive or attractive) to the nodes. 
A Lombardi drawing of a graph is a drawing where the edges are drawn as circular arcs (straight edges are considered circular arcs of infinite radius) with perfect angular resolution. This means, that consecutive edges around a vertex are equally spaced around it. In other words, each angle between the tangents of two consecutive edges is equal to $2\pi/d$ where d is the degree of that specific vertex. The requirement of using circular edges in graphs when we want to provide perfect angular resolution is necessary, since even cycle graphs cannot be drawn with straight edges when perfect angular resolution is needed. 
In this survey, we provide an algorithm that takes as input a random drawing of a graph and provides its Lombardi drawing, giving a proper visualization of the graph."

A human instructor can teach students how to draw by encouraging them to practice established drawing techniques and by providing personal and directed feedback to foster their artistic intuition and perception. This thesis describes the first methodology for a computer application to mimic a human instructor by providing direction and feedback to assist a student in drawing a human face from a photograph. Nine design principles were discovered and developed for providing such instruction, presenting reference media, giving corrective feedback, and receiving actions from the student. Face recognition is used to model the human face in a photograph so that sketch recognition can map a drawing to the model and evaluate it. New sketch recognition techniques and algorithms were created in order to perform sketch understanding on such subjective content. After two iterations of development and user studies for this methodology, the result is a computer application that can guide a person toward producing his/her own sketch of a human model in a reference photograph with step-bystep instruction and computer generated feedback."

In this work, we propose a method to leverage the talent of traditionally trained hand animators to create three-dimensional animation of human motion, while allowing them to work in the medium that is familiar to them. The input to our algorithm is a set of hand-animated frames. Our key insight is to use motion capture data as a source of domain knowledge and 'lift' the two-dimensional animation to three dimensions, while maintaining the unique style of the input animation. A motion capture clip is projected to two dimensions. First, time alignment is done to match the timing of the hand-drawn frames and then, the limbs are aligned to better match the pose in the hand-drawn frames. Finally the motion is reconstructed in three dimensions. We demonstrate our algorithm on a variety of hand animated motion sequences on different characters, including ballet, a stylized sneaky walk, and a sequence of jumping jacks."

Aided Des.,2009,27,"Freehand sketching is widely regarded as an efficient and natural way for interaction between computers and humans. We present a robust computerized scheme to automatically segment freehand sketches into a series of components with specific geometric meaning regardless of whether these are generated online or offline. This task is a necessary first step toward sketch understanding. By exploiting the interpolation / extrapolation characteristic of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs), a greedy algorithm consisting of forward and backward operations is proposed for finding the minimum set of segmentation points that can be used to reconstruct with high fitting accuracy freehand sketches in the form of implicit functions. To obtain segmentation points, a simple angle based rule is used to remove ""bridging"" points that provide a smooth transition between consecutive sketch components. Feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by a preliminary performance assessment study using ten computer generated drawings. These experiments show that in this dataset sensitivity of the segmentation was higher than 97.5% with a false positive (FP) rate of approximately 25%. The majority of false positive identifications are located on arc regions where a larger number of segmentation points are needed for reconstruction purposes. The primary contribution of this algorithm is that it transforms an ambiguous problem namely, freehand sketch segmentation, into an implicit function fitting operation. Therefore, this proposed approach has several advantages including independence of the actual sketching activity, and the ability for a satisfactory detection of the transition point between a line and an arc or between two arcs."

It is becoming an interesting research topic, but it remains an open issue to specify the caricature's pattern for the input face. This paper proposed a novel pattern prediction method based on MR (manifold regularization), which comprises three steps. Firstly, we learn the caricature pattern by manifold dimension reduction, and select some low dimensional caricature pattern as the labels for corresponsive true faces. Secondly, manifold regularization is performed to build a semi-supervised regression between true faces and the pattern labels. In the third step of offline phase, the input face is mapped to a pattern label by the learnt regressive model, and the pattern label is further transformed to caricature parameters by a locally linear reconstruction algorithm. This approach takes advantage of manifold structure lying in both true faces and caricatures. Experiments show that, low dimensional manifold represents the caricature pattern well and the semi-supervised regressive model from manifold regularization can predict the target caricature pattern successfully."

The facial feature extraction requires an offline training process which uses natural expression annotated images from 30 model subjects, selected randomly from the Cohn-Kanade Database. The results show that from an input facial image, expressive caricatures are generated for the main six face expressions (smile, sad, fear, surprise, disgust, and anger). The proposed approach yields to promising expressive caricatures, and could lead to future research directions in the field of non-photorealistic rendering.

A framework for synthesizing lifelike portraits from user specifications and input sketches is proposed which is an inverse process of sketch generation. The proposed framework synthesizes the realistic appearance of a face by taking parts from an annotated face library of photographs and stitching them together followed by further deformation.
 The algorithm consists of three parts primarily: First, given user specifications and an input sketch, search good matches for each facial component in the library; Second, extract each facial component from matching source images and composite them together; Third, deform the synthesized lifelike portraits to further approximate the sketch. The key component lies in a measurement for finding the right contents to bridge the gap between shapes and lifelike images. A set of diverse lifelike portraits can be synthesized from a single sketch. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a variety of experimental results."

However, there is no similarly easy process for animating these models. In this paper we present an automatic skeletalisation and rigging algorithm for sketch-based models. Our algorithm analyses sketched contours and creates fully automatically a hierarchical skeleton with joints. The surface mesh is bound to the curved skeleton bones using skinning techniques and the resulting model can be animated using skeletal animation techniques. Our analysis and user evaluation suggests that the joints placements are perceived as natural. The models can be animated using traditional skeletal animation techniques such as key-framing and motion capturing, or can be used as input to physically-based animation techniques and evolutionary algorithms."

However, efficient implementations for challenging programs require a combination of high-level algorithmic insights and low-level implementation details. Deriving the low-level details is a natural job for a computer, but the synthesizer can not replace the human insight. Therefore, one of the central challenges for software synthesis is to establish a synergy between the programmer and the synthesizer, exploiting the programmer's expertise to reduce the burden on the synthesizer. 
This thesis introduces sketching, a new style of synthesis that offers a fresh approach to the synergy problem. Previous approaches have relied on meta-programming, or variations of interactive theorem proving to help the synthesizer deduce an efficient implementation. The resulting systems are very powerful, but they require the programmer to master new formalisms far removed from traditional programming models. To make synthesis accessible, programmers must be able to provide their insight effortlessly, using formalisms they already understand. 
In Sketching, insight is communicated through a partial program, a sketch that expresses the high-level structure of an implementation but leaves holes in place of the low-level details. This form of synthesis is made possible by a new SAT-based inductive synthesis procedure that can efficiently synthesize an implementation from a small number of test cases. This algorithm forms the core of a new counterexample guided inductive synthesis procedure (CEGIS) which combines the inductive synthesizer with a validation procedure to automatically generate test inputs and ensure that the generated program satisfies its specification. With a few extensions, CEGIS can even use its sequential inductive synthesizer to generate concurrent programs; all the concurrency related reasoning is delegated to an off-the-shelf validation procedure. 
The resulting synthesis system scales to real programming problems from a variety of domains ranging from bit-level ciphers to manipulations of linked datastructures. The system was even used to produce a complete optimized implementation of the AES cipher. The concurrency aware synthesizer was also used to synthesize, in a matter of minutes, the details of a fine-locking scheme for a concurrent set, a sense reversing barrier, and even a solution to the dining philosophers problem. 
The system was also extended with domain specific knowledge to better handle the problem of implementing stencil computations, an important domain in scientific computing. For this domain, we were able to encode domain specific insight as a problem reduction that converted stencil sketches into simplified sketch problems which CEGIS resolved in a matter of minutes. This specialized synthesizer was used to quickly implement a MultiGrid solver for partial differential equations containing many difficult implementation strategies from the literature. 
In short, this thesis shows that sketching is a viable approach to making synthesis practical in a general programming context."

Our process starts with video of a person whose gesturing style we wish to animate. A tool-assisted annotation process is performed on the video, from which a statistical model of the person's particular gesturing style is built. Using this model and input text tagged with theme, rheme and focus, our generation algorithm creates a gesture script. As opposed to isolated singleton gestures, our gesture script specifies a stream of continuous gestures coordinated with speech. This script is passed to an animation system, which enhances the gesture description with additional detail. It then generates either kinematic or physically simulated motion based on this description. The system is capable of generating gesture animations for novel text that are consistent with a given performer's style, as was successfully validated in an empirical user study."

We propose a new low-level recognition and beautification system that can recognize eight primitive shapes, as well as combinations of these primitives, with recognition rates at 98.56%. Our system also automatically generates beautified versions of these shapes to provide feedback early in the sketching process.

In the second stage, joint analysis of correlations between these elementary head gesture and prosody patterns is performed using Multi-Stream HMMs to determine an audio-visual mapping model. The resulting audio-visual mapping model is then employed to synthesize natural head gestures from arbitrary input test speech given a head model for the speaker. In the synthesis stage, the audio-visual mapping model is used to predict a sequence of gesture patterns from the prosody pattern sequence computed for the input test speech. The Euler angles associated with each gesture pattern are then applied to animate the speaker head model. Objective and subjective evaluations indicate that the proposed synthesis by analysis scheme provides natural looking head gestures for the speaker with any input test speech, as well as in ``prosody transplant"" and ``gesture transplant"" scenarios."

With the advent of inexpensive tablet PCs, online sketches have become more common, allowing for stroke-based sketch recognition techniques, more powerful editing techniques, and automatic simulation of recognized diagrams. Online sketches provide significantly more information than paper sketches, but they still do not provide the flexibility, naturalness, and simplicity of a simple piece of paper. Recognition methods exist for paper sketches, but they tend to be domain specific and don't benefit from the advances of stroke-based sketch recognition. Our goal is to combine the power of stroke-based sketch recognition with the flexibility and ease of use of a piece of paper. In this paper we will present a stroke-tracing algorithm that can be used to extract stroke data from the pixilated image of the sketch drawn on paper. The presented method handles overlapping strokes and also attempts to capture sequencing information, which is helpful in many sketch recognition techniques. We present preliminary results of our algorithm on several paper-drawn, hand-sketched, scanned-in pixilated images."

First, the edge of the color image is detected by Sobel operator. Next, the color image is sharpened by Unsharp Mask (USM), and then color scaling is used to get an image with radial and edge details. Furthermore, the original image is divided into many meaningful regions using an efficient method of image segmentation, then the texture direction is determined by Fourier transform and shape feature. To render better effects of illumination and local texture of pencil drawing, the line integral convolution (LIC) algorithm is applied and combined with color scaling and white noise image. Finally, the pencil drawing is created and the generation results from the superposition of the edge, the USM image, and the texture. Experimental results prove that our method could enhance the generated efficiency greatly by creating a more obvious edge, more natural tone, and more real texture than those offered by existed methods."

To accommodate this operation, numerous existing phonetic systems using the Roman alphabet were adopted as a means of input while still making use of a Western keyboard. With the growing prevalence of computing devices capable of pen-based input, naturally sketching written Chinese using a phonetic system becomes possible, and is also generally faster and simpler than sketching entire Chinese characters. One method for sketching Chinese characters for computing devices capable of pen-based input involves using an existing non-alphabetic phonetic system called the Mandarin Phonetic Symbols I (MPS1). The benefits of inputting Chinese characters by its corresponding MPS1 symbols – unlike letters from its alphabetic-based counterpart – is that it retains the phonemic components of the corresponding Chinese characters. The work in the paper describes our geometric-based MPS1 recognition system, a system designed particularly for novice users of MPS1 symbols that gives reasonable vision-based recognition rates and provides useful feedback for symbols drawn with incorrect sketching technique such as stroke order."

Diagram animation is driven by implicit associations that are inferred, either automatically or with gestural guidance, from mathematical expressions, diagram labels, and drawing elements. The modeless nature of mathematical sketching enables users to switch freely between modifying diagrams or expressions and viewing animations.

The goal of this preliminary study is to consider the role of a designer's sketching ability and to examine the potential link between sketching skill and measures of engineering design performance. Sketching ability was evaluated on three distinct aspects relevant to engineering design: visual recall, rendering, and novel visualization. These evaluations were correlated with each other and with measures for sketch fluency, reviewer ranking, and design project outcome. The results of this study suggest that sketching skill is not comprehensive nor is it solely task based. Rather, a designer's sketching ability lies between these two poles. Positive correlations were found between the quantity of sketches produced and two of the sketching skills that emphasize drawing facility, but a negative correlation was found between sketch quantity and a skill related to mechanism visualization. No conclusive correlations were found between the sketching skills and design outcome and reviewer ranking. This study's findings suggest an important interplay between a designer's ability to sketch and their ability to visualize in their heads or through prototypes. Results also suggest that designers who are given sketch instruction tended to draw more overall."

We investigate whether the recognition of facial composites, or pictures of criminal faces, could be similarly enhanced. In this study, participants first estimated the degree of caricature necessary to make composites most identifiable. Contrary to expectation, an anticaricature was found to be best, presumably as this tended to reduce the appearance of errors. In support of this explanation, more positive caricature estimates were assigned to morphed composites: representations that tend to contain less overall error. In addition, anticaricaturing reduced identification for morphed composites but enhanced identification for individual composites. Although such improvements were too small to be of value to law enforcement, a sizeable naming benefit was observed when presenting a range of caricature states, which appeared to capitalize on individual differences in the internal representation of familiar faces."

Change detection is an important primitive which can be extended to construct many aggregate queries. The recently proposed sketches are among the very few that can detect heavy changes online for high speed links, and thus support various aggregate queries in both temporal and spatial domains. However, it does not preserve the keys (e. g., source IP address) of flows, making it difficult to reconstruct the desired set of anomalous keys. To address this challenge, we propose the reversible sketch data structure along with reverse hashing algorithms to infer the keys of culprit flows. There are two phases. The first operates online, recording the packet stream in a compact representation with negligible extra memory and few extra memory accesses. Our prototype single FPGA board implementation can achieve a throughput of over 16 Gb/s for 40-byte packet streams (the worst case). The second phase identifies heavy changes and their keys from the representation in nearly real time. We evaluate our scheme using traces from large edge routers with OC-12 or higher links. Both the analytical and experimental results show that we are able to achieve online traffic monitoring and accurate change/intrusion detection over massive data streams on high speed links, all in a manner that scales to large key space size.

In recent years there has been an increasing interest in sketch-based user interfaces, but the problem of robust free-sketch recognition remains largely unsolved. Current computer sketch recognition systems are difficult to construct, and either are fragile or accomplish robustness by severely limiting the designer's drawing freedom. 
This work explores the challenges of multi-domain sketch recognition. We present a general framework and implemented system, called SketchREAD , for diagrammatic sketch recognition. Our system can be applied to a variety of domains by providing structural descriptions of the shapes in the domain. Robustness to the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent in complex, freely-drawn sketches is achieved through the use of context. Our approach uses context to guide the search for possible interpretations and uses a novel form of dynamically constructed Bayesian networks to evaluate these interpretations. This process allows the system to recover from low-level recognition errors (e.g., a line misclassified as an arc) that would otherwise result in domain level recognition errors. We evaluated SketchREAD on real sketches in two domains—family trees and circuit diagrams—and found that in both domains the use of context to reclassify low-level shapes significantly reduced recognition error over a baseline system that did not reinterpret low-level classifications. We discuss remaining challenges for multi-domain sketch recognition revealed by our evaluation. Finally, we explore the system's potential role in sketch-based user interfaces from a human computer interaction perspective.

Sketch recognition systems are currently being developed for many domains. However, they require signal-processing expertise if they are to handle the intricacies of each domain, and they are time-consuming to build. 
Our goal is to enable user interface designers and domain experts who may not have expertise in sketch recognition to be able to build these sketch systems. We created and implemented a new framework (FLUID - facilitating user interface development) in which developers can specify a domain description indicating how domain shapes are to be recognized, displayed, and edited. This description is then automatically transformed into a sketch recognition user interface for that domain. LADDER, a language using a perceptual vocabulary based on Gestalt principles, was developed to describe how to recognize, display, and edit domain shapes. A translator and a customizable recognition system (GUILD - a generator of user interfaces using ladder descriptions) are combined with a domain description to automatically create a domain specific recognition system. With this new technology, by writing a domain description, developers are able to create a new sketch interface for a domain, greatly reducing the time and expertise for the task. 
Continuing in pursuit of our goal to facilitate UI development, we noted that (1) human generated descriptions contained syntactic and conceptual errors, and that (2) it is more natural for a user to specify a shape by drawing it than by editing text. However, computer generated descriptions from a single drawn example are also flawed, as one cannot express all allowable variations in a single example. 
In response, we created a modification of the traditional model of active learning in which the system selectively generates its own near-miss examples and uses the human teacher as a source of labels. System generated near-misses offer a number of advantages. Human generated examples are tedious to create and may not expose problems in the current concept. It seems most effective for the near-miss examples to be generated by whichever learning participant (teacher or student) knows better where the deficiencies lie; this will allow the concepts to be more quickly and effectively refined. When working in a closed domain such as this one, the computer learner knows exactly which conceptual uncertainties remain, and which hypotheses need to be tested and confirmed. The system uses these labeled examples to automatically build a LADDER shape description, using a modification of the version spaces algorithm that handles interrelated constraints, and which also has the ability to learn negative and disjunctive constraints."

A main difficulty lies in reliably extracting and recognizing the intended set of visual objects from a continuous stream of pen strokes. Existing pen-based systems either avoid these issues altogether, thus resulting in the equivalent of a drawing program, or rely on algorithms that place unnatural constraints on the way the user draws. As one step toward alleviating these difficulties, we present an integrated sketch parsing and recognition approach designed to enable natural, fluid, sketch-based computer interaction. The techniques presented in this paper are oriented toward the domain of network diagrams. In the first step of our approach, the stream of pen strokes is examined to identify the arrows in the sketch. The identified arrows then anchor a spatial analysis which groups the uninterpreted strokes into distinct clusters, each representing a single object. Finally, a trainable shape recognizer, which is informed by the spatial analysis, is used to find the best interpretations of the clusters. Based on these concepts, we have built SimuSketch, a sketch-based interface for Matlab's Simulink software package.

The statistics-based synthesis module can exaggerate shapes and positions of facial features based on non-linear exaggerative rates determined automatically. Instead of comparing only the inter relationship between features of different subjects at the existing methods, our synthesis module applies both inter and intra (i.e. comparisons between facial features of the same subject) relationships to make the synthesized exaggerative shape more contrastive. Subsequently, the NPR module generates a line-drawing sketch of original face, and then the sketch is warped to an exaggerative style with synthesized shape points.

Pinto,ad1114c98d5a8bddd073b2b17ef3841819e2367c,"Reusable facial rigging and animation: create once, use many",,2007,14,"Facial animation is a serious bottleneck in any computer generated (CG) production, It is the key element to convey emotion to 3D characters. Speeding up the rigging process remains an unresolved problem, specially for film and videogames, that require high quality results. The character rigging is analogous to setting up the strings that control a puppet. Today, skilled artists manually create the facial rig to ensure the best quality in the animations; but, this is a slow, labor-intensive and costly process. This thesis presents a portable character rigging system that integrates into current animation production pipelines. It automatically transfers the facial rig and animations created for one character to different characters, independent of their shape and appearance. It enables artists to create more lifelike facial models in less time; about 90-99 percent faster than traditional manual rigging. Characters can display complex expressions and behavior, easier and with decreased artistic effort. As a result, we dramatically reduce the time needed to create high-quality facial animations for the entertainment industry.
We studied techniques from the fields of computer graphics and computer vision, to come up with a solution to the rigging problem. Based on a generic facial rig definition and a new deformation method, our system converts 3D face models into digital puppets that experienced artists can control. The system adapts the skeleton, weights and influence objects (NURBS surfaces, lattice, etc.) from a source rig to individual face models to obtain unique expressions, and enables easy re-use of existing animation scripts. Our work differs from previous morphing and retargeting techniques, because that work was oriented towards transferring animations, while ours aims to transfer the complete facial rig, in addition to animations.
The system was validated with a series of experiments. We used models and rigs from major film and videogame companies (Electr"

User input is through sketching, or a combination of sketching and speech. Course of Action symbols are recognized incrementally, and the informal sketching input is replaced with formal images of the symbols. The system uses the LADDER shape definition language to represent the geometric properties of shapes, and is capable of recognizing 327 distinct Course of Action symbols. The Intermediate Feature Recognizer is used to recognize shapes of intermediate complexity and is capable of recognizing some shapes that cannot be described using LADDER defintions. By detecting features of intermediate complexity, the system is capable of automatic error correction of some stroke segmentation errors and dealing with filled-in and multi-segment lines. The system is also able to recognize a combination of speech and sketching input of some information that can’t easily be communicated through sketching alone. The system has a shape grammar to allow the sketch recognizer to conform to rules for creating Course of Action symbols. The system is also capable of “interpreting” the sketch understanding the higher-level details of military units and actions that were sketched in the Course of Action diagram.

For example, previous work has aggregated netflow records into origin-destination (OD) flows, yielding a much smaller set of dimensions which can then be mined to uncover anomalies. However, this approach can only identify which OD flow is anomalous, not the particular IP flow(s) responsible for the anomaly. In this paper we show how one can use random aggregations of IP flows (i.e., sketches) to enable more precise identification of the underlying causes of anomalies. We show how to combine traffic sketches with a subspace method to (1) detect anomalies with high accuracy and (2) identify the IP flows(s) that are responsible for the anomaly. Our method has detection rates comparable to previous methods and detects many more anomalies than prior work, taking us a step closer towards a robust on-line system for anomaly detection and identification."

The proposed method works effectively on colorizing black-and-white manga which contains intensive amount of strokes, hatching, halftoning and screening. Such fine details and discontinuities in intensity introduce many difficulties to intensity-based colorization methods. Once the user scribbles on the drawing, a local, statistical based pattern feature obtained with Gabor wavelet filters is applied to measure the pattern-continuity. The boundary is then propagated by the level set method that monitors the pattern-continuity. Regions with open boundaries or multiple disjointed regions with similar patterns can be sensibly segmented by a single scribble. With the segmented regions, various colorization techniques can be applied to replace colors, colorize with stroke preservation, or even convert pattern to shading. Several results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and convenience of the proposed method."

Aided Des.,2006,86,"A large amount of 2D drawings have been produced in engineering fields. To reuse and share the available drawings efficiently, we propose two methods in this paper, namely 2.5D spherical harmonics transformation and 2D shape histogram, to retrieve 2D drawings by measuring their shape similarity. The first approach represents a drawing as a spherical function by transforming it from a 2D space into a 3D space. Then a fast spherical harmonics transformation is employed to get a rotation invariant descriptor. The second statistics-based approach represents the shape of a 2D drawing using a distance distribution between two randomly sampled points. To allow users to interactively emphasize certain local shapes that they are interested in, we have adopted a flexible sampling strategy by specifying a bias sampling density upon these local shapes. The two proposed methods have many valuable properties, including transform invariance, efficiency, and robustness. In addition, their insensitivity to noise allows for the user's causal input, thus supporting a freehand sketch-based retrieval user interface. Experiments show that a better performance can be achieved by combining them together using weights."

The purpose here is not just to understand what determines the final prices of art objects but also the price movement during the entire auction. We identify several factors such as artist characteristics (established or emerging artist; prior sales history), art characteristics (size; painting medium - canvas or paper), competition characteristics (current no. of bidders; current no. of bids) and auction design characteristics (opening bid; position of the lot in the auction) that explain the dynamics of price movement in an online art auction. We find that the effects on price vary over the duration of the auction, with some of these effects being stronger at the beginning of the auction (such as the opening bid and historical prices realized). In some cases, the rate of change in prices (velocity) increases at the end of the auction (for canvas paintings and paintings by established artists). Our analysis suggests that the opening bid is positively related to online auction price levels of art at the beginning of the auction but its effect declines towards the end of the auction. The order in which the lots appear in an art auction is negatively related to the current price level with this relationship decreasing towards the end of the auction. This implies that lots that appear earlier have higher current prices during the early part of the auction but that effect diminishes by the end of the auction. Established artists show a positive relationship with the price level at the beginning of the auction. Reputation or popularity of the artists and their investment potential as assessed by previous history of sales are positively related to the price levels at the beginning of the auction. The medium (canvas or paper) of the painting did not show any relationship with art auction price levels, but the size of the painting was negatively related to the current price during the early part of the auction. Important implications for auction design are drawn from the analysis."

The proposed method contains three parts: (1) pose determination of a 3D model; (2) 2D orthogonal view generation along the orientations; and (3) similarity measurement between a user's sketches and the 2D views. Users can submit one, two or three views intuitively as a query, which are similar to the three main views in engineering drawing. It is worth pointing point out that our method only needs three views, while 13 views is the minimum set that has been reported by other researchers."

Our work uses spatial relationships, shape geometry and high-dimensional indexing mechanisms to retrieve complex drawings from CAD databases. This contrasts with conventional approaches which use mostly textual metadata. Creative designers and draftspeople often re-use data from previous projects, publications and libraries of ready-to-use components. Usually, retrieving these drawings is a slow, complex and error-prone endeavour. Unfortunately, the widespread use of CAD systems, while making it easier to create drawings, exacerbates this problem, insofar as the number of projects grows enormously, without providing adequate searching mechanisms to support retrieving these documents. We describe an approach that supports automatic indexation of technical drawing databases through drawing simplification, feature extraction and efficient algorithms to index large amounts of data. We describe in detail our classification process and present results from usability tests on our prototype."

Exaggerating the Difference from the Mean (EDFM) is widely accepted among caricaturists to be the driving factor behind caricature generation. However the caricatures created by different artists have different drawing style. No attempt has been taken in the past to identify these distinct drawing styles. Yet the proper identification of the drawing style of an artist will allow the accurate modelling of a personalised exaggeration process, leading to fully automatic caricature generation with increased accuracy. In this paper we provide experimental results and detailed analysis to prove that a Cascade Correlation Neural Network (CCNN) can be used for capturing the drawing style of an artist and thereby used in realistic automatic caricature generation. This work is the first attempt to use neural networks in this application area and have the potential to revolutionize existing automatic caricature generation technologies."

Mathematical sketching derives from the familiar pencil-and-paper process of drawing supporting diagrams to facilitate the formulation of mathematical expressions; however, with a mathematical sketch, users can also leverage their physical intuition by watching their hand-drawn diagrams animate in response to continuous or discrete parameter changes in their written formulas. Diagram animation is driven by implicit associations that are inferred, either automatically or with gestural guidance, from mathematical expressions, diagram labels, and drawing elements. The modeless nature of mathematical sketching enables users to switch freely between modifying diagrams or expressions and viewing animations.

Current computer sketch recognition systems are difficult to construct, and either are fragile or accomplish robustness by severely limiting the designer's drawing freedom. Our system can be applied to a variety of domains by providing structural descriptions of the shapes in that domain; no training data or programming is necessary. Robustness to the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent in complex, freely-drawn sketches is achieved through the use of context. The system uses context to guide the search for possible interpretations and uses a novel form of dynamically constructed Bayesian networks to evaluate these interpretations. This process allows the system to recover from low-level recognition errors (e.g., a line misclassified as an arc) that would otherwise result in domain level recognition errors. We evaluated Sketch-READ on real sketches in two domains--family trees and circuit diagrams--and found that in both domains the use of context to reclassify low-level shapes significantly reduced recognition error over a baseline system that did not reinterpret low-level classifications. We also discuss the system's potential role in sketch based user interfaces."

The detection typically treats the traffic as a collection of flows and looks for heavy changes in traffic patterns (<i>e.g.</i>, volume, number of connections). However, as link speeds and the number of flows increase, keeping per-flow state is not scalable. The recently proposed sketch-based schemes [14] are among the very few that can detect heavy changes and anomalies over massive data streams at network traffic speeds. However, sketches do not preserve the key (<i>e.g.</i>, source IP address) of the flows. Hence, even if anomalies are detected, it is difficult to infer the culprit flows, making it a big practical hurdle for online deployment. Meanwhile, the number of keys is too large to record.
 To address this challenge, we propose efficient <i>reversible hashing</i> algorithms to infer the keys of culprit flows from sketches without storing any explicit key information. No extra memory or memory accesses are needed for recording the streaming data. Meanwhile, the heavy change detection daemon runs in the background with space complexity and computational time sublinear to the key space size. This short paper describes the conceptual framework of the reversible sketches, as well as some initial approaches for implementation. See [23] for the optimized algorithms in details. comment We further apply various emph IP-mangling algorithms and emph bucket classification methods to reduce the false positives and false negatives. Evaluated with netflow traffic traces of a large edge router, we demonstrate that the reverse hashing can quickly infer the keys of culprit flows even for many changes with high accuracy."

Brennan’s “Caricature generator” program produced caricatures by manually defining a polyline drawing with topology corresponding to a frontal, mean, face-shape drawing, and then displacing the vertices by a constant factor away from the mean shape. Many psychological studies have applied the “Caricature Generator” or EDFM idea to investigate caricaturerelated issues in face perception [Rhodes 1997]."

This combination of drawing and conceptual labeling is a very natural and effective form of communication and problemsolving. Creating software that can participate in sketching provides many challenges. We outline the nuSketch approach to sketch understanding, which focuses on visual and conceptual understanding instead of recognition. We summarize three experiments in progress with the sketching Knowledge Entry Associate (sKEA), the first open-domain sketch understanding system. sKEA exploits a variety of visual and qualitative spatial reasoning capabilities and human-like analogical matching to tackle a variety of tasks. We present experimental results, and outline future plans. The nuSketch approach Sketching is a form of multimodal interaction where participants use a combination of interactive drawing and language to provide high-bandwidth communication. This communication relies on shared understanding, both visual and conceptual. Multimodal interface research has mainly focused on providing more natural interfaces to legacy software, using recognition technologies to provide the desired interaction (Alvarado and Davis 2001, Cohen et al. 1997). While such systems have been shown to be quite useful in practice, we take a radically different approach. The nuSketch approach is based on a key observation about human-to-human sketching: Recognition is not essential. People are not artists in real time; they rely on language for conceptual labeling much of the time. While some specialized domains have visual symbol languages that practitioners use fluently, sketching is used far more broadly than that. In other words, for people, recognition is an accelerant, not a necessity. This suggests a very different approach to sketch understanding that complements recognition-oriented research. In the nuSketch approach, we sidestep recognition issues by providing other interface mechanisms for people to conceptually label their ink. This provides two crucial advantages. First, it enables us to focus on deeper visual and conceptual understanding of sketches. Second, it enables us to build sketching systems that can operate outside the tight domain constraints that bind today’s recognition-based systems. In particular, the sketching Knowledge Entry Associate (sKEA) (Forbus and Usher 2002) is, we believe, the first open-domain sketch understanding system. sKEA’s only coverage limitation comes from the underlying knowledge base it uses – currently a subset of Cyc, consisting of over 35,000 concepts, constrained by 1.2M facts. This does not mean that we can effectively reason with all of these concepts in sketches yet – that is the nature of the challenge we have undertaken! The nuSketch Architecture and sKEA In the nuSketch architecture, the basic unit in a sketch is a glyph. Every glyph has ink and content. The ink consists of one or more poly-lines, representing what the user drew. The content is a conceptual entity, the kind of thing that the glyph is representing. There are two key problems that any sketching system must solve: 1. Segmentation. What pieces of ink should be considered together as glyphs? 2. Conceptual Labeling. What conceptual entity does a glyph denote? We solve the segmentation problem by having the user click a button when they begin drawing a glyph and click it again when they are finished. Other segmentation techniques, such as time-outs and connectivity, are in our experience very frustrating for users and error-prone. We solve the conceptual labeling problem by enabling the content of a glyph to be declared, via a simple dialog, as one or more types drawn from the underlying knowledge base. This requires users to be familiar with the subset of the knowledge base that they need in their task, which is a strong limitation with the current version of the system. (We return to this issue at the end.) The nuSketch architecture uses a variety of geometric computations to visually construct qualitative representations, including RCC8 relations (Cohen 1996), Voronoi diagrams (Edwards and Moulin 1998) for approximating proximity, and polygon operations to capture domain constraints. A central feature of nuSketch is our use of analogical processing, based on Gentner’s structure-mapping theory (Gentner 1983). Analogy provides a powerful means of entering and testing knowledge. Currently sKEA enables users to compare two layers of a sketch, which enables the detection of similarities and differences. We use the Structure-Mapping Engine (SME) (Falkenhainer, Forbus and Gentner 1989) to perform the comparisons. SME is a general-purpose analogical matcher. sKEA’s analogies are based on both the visual and the conceptual material in a sketch. Some of our experiments also take advantage of the MAC/FAC system (Forbus, Gentner and Law 1994) which does a coarse matching using content vectors and then uses SME to narrow the results. SME produces candidate inferences, conjectures about one description based on its alignment with another. Candidate inferences are useful in knowledge capture because they suggest ways to flesh out a description based on similarities with prior knowledge. Since there is independent psychological evidence that structural alignment occurs in visual processing, and that SME captures many aspects of this processing accurately, it means that when our sense of similarity and our software’s sense of similarity about a sketch diverge, it is a sign that our representations have failed to capture something crucial about the sketch. This provides a powerful constraint that drives the visual and conceptual representations we compute. Even if one does not care about modeling human performance, a sketching system will be a better partner if you and it agree on when things look alike. Spatial Processing in nuSketch and sKEA While we do not use recognition techniques on our sketches, we do compute some simple spatial properties of the ink (Forbus and Usher 2002). We focus on the spatial relationships between the glyphs rather than doing detailed analysis of the structure of the glyphs themselves; we call this approach blob semantics. When a glyph is added, moved, or resized, sKEA computes a set of spatial attributes and relationships. This process is described in detail in (Forbus, Tomai, and Usher 2003). The spatial attributes and relationships that make up the visual structure of the sketch are: groupings, positional relationships, size, and orientation. sKEA automatically computes two kinds of groupings: contained glyph groups and connected glyph groups. A contained group consists of a single container glyph and the set of glyphs that are fully contained within it, possibly tangentially so. The contained group does not include glyphs that are contained within other glyphs in the group. A connected glyph group consists of a set of glyphs that overlap ink strokes with one another. Articulation points can be computed over connected glyph groups and tangentially connected pairs of glyphs can be noted as such. Positional relationships are computed pair-wise and expressed in a viewer-oriented coordinate system of left/right and above/below. They are not computed between all pairs of glyphs, but rather in local neighborhoods based on adjacency, as determined via a Voronoi diagram. Positional relationships are computed only between glyphs on the same layer of a sketch. Glyph size in sKEA is assigned as either tiny, small, medium, large or huge. Sizes are based on the area of a glyph’s axis-aligned bounding box, a coarse but empirically useful approximation. Glyph areas are normalized with respect to either the area of the bounding box around all glyphs on all layers or the users view port, whichever is larger. The normalized areas are then clustered into qualitative size values based on a logarithmic scale of the square root of the area. Additional Spatial Reasoning As part of our ongoing research we are developing more spatial reasoning capabilities to accomplish different research goals. Currently we are working on adding the ability to articulate the “important” points and segments on different objects as well as to more specifically define the relationship between adjacent glyphs. Another area where we need to expand our available spatial reasoning abilities is curvature. We are working on different techniques to qualitative summarize degree of curvature."

The stereo camera performs real-time, untethered, vision-based tracking of the onlooker's head, torso and limb movements, which in turn are routed to a 3D-gesture recognition agent. Using speech, 3D deictic gesture and 2D object de-referencing the system is able to track the onlooker's suggestion to move a specific milestone. The system also has a speech recognition agent capable of recognizing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words as phonetic sequences. Thus when a user at the whiteboard speaks an OOV label name for a chart constituent while also writing it, the OOV speech is combined with letter sequences hypothesized by the handwriting recognizer to yield an orthography, pronunciation and semantics for the new label. These are then learned dynamically by the system and become immediately available for future recognition."

In this paper, we introduce a method to transfer color from a reference image to the whole video. Although the general problem of adding chromatic values to a grayscale image has no exact, objective solution, the current approach attempts to free user from laborious work, except that the user may contribute their skill to reference image. Rather than choosing RGB colors from a palette to color individual components, we resort to anther color space, called lαβ, which minimizes correlation between channels for many natural scenes. Taking advantage of the correlation between two conjoint frames of video, we track the object and assign the color of it in the preceding frame to that of the posterior one. Experimental results show the algorithm works quite well."

There are two popular primitives for efficient analysis over massive data streams: heavy hitter detection and heavy change detection. Although numerous approaches have been proposed for efficient heavy hitter detection [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], the sketch-based scheme [6] is one of the very few that can detect heavy changes and anomalies over massive data streams at network traffic speeds. However, sketches do not preserve keys (e.g., source IP address) of the flows. Thus even if anomalies are detected, it is difficult to infer the culprit flows. To address this challenge, we propose efficient reversible hashing schemes to infer the keys of culprit flows from sketches with negligible extra memory and few extra memory accesses for recording streaming data implementing on a single FPGA board, we can achieve a throughput of over 16Gbps for all 40-byte-packet streams (the worst case traffic). Meanwhile, the heavy change detection daemon runs in the background with space complexity and computational time sublinear to the key space size. Evaluation with traces from a large edge router show that we can infer the keys for even 1,000 heavy changes while achieving over a 99% real positive percentage and less than a 0.5% false positive percentage in 22 seconds."

This paper presents a method of synthesizing a caricature having higher flexibility in controlling individual shape features of various parts of a face, as well as features of arrangements and inclines of these parts. In addition, it obtains eigenspaces for contours of facial parts such as the eyebrows, eyes, and mouth. It also obtains eigenspaces for arrangements of various facial parts. Next, it obtains differences of the shapes and arrangements of the facial parts with the average face and performs orthogonal expansion to the eigenspace bases (eigenvectors) on these differences. It determines magnifying power according to the coefficients obtained by orthogonal expansion and performs an emphasizing procedure on eigenvectors. The differences with the slopes of the facial parts of the average face are emphasized for the slopes of the facial parts using a second-order function. It obtains the shape of a caricature by adding the mean shape, mean arrangement, and mean slope to these results. The efficacy of the caricature synthesis method is verified by subjective evaluation tests on synthesized faces. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The method enables the automated extraction, position identification and drawing order of individual sides of a shape within a drawing. Discrimination between two populations (a neglect population and stroke subjects without neglect as determined by existing standard assessment methods) using a combination of performance features and constructional sequence is examined across three separate drawing tasks. Results from experimentation show how a combination of sequence and performance features is able to generalize across a wide variety of input samples and obtain a diagnostic classification which can be used alongside other forms of conventional assessment. Furthermore, the application of a multi-classifier combination strategy leads to a significant increase in recognition ability."

The system learns how to exaggerate features based on training examples from a particular caricaturist. The input to the system is a frontal face image along with its vector based line-drawing. The system creates a face shape model of the given face with a minimum of user interaction. The face shape is then converted to a set of semantic face features. A Kernel Regression (KR) algorithm determines how much each feature should be exaggerated based on the knowledge learned from a particular artist. The exaggerated features are then projected into an exaggerated face shape using a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm. This MLE algorithm also maintains face constraints to generate reasonable caricatures. Finally, the exaggerated face shape together with the unexaggerated face shape are used to morph the input line-drawing to create a caricature. A user interface is provided to indicate the extent of overall exaggeration.

The new approach that we will be trying to introduce is based on using variant strings generated by the search algorithm (searcher) during the tree expansion in decision making. We hope to prove that this approach is more efficient than the standard treatment of the issue, especially in positions with few pieces (endgames). To illustrate what we have in mind a machine language routine that implements our theoretical assumptions is attached. The routine is part of the Axon chess program, developed by the authors.

The detection typically treats the traffic as a collection of flows that need to be examined for significant changes in traffic pattern (eg, volume, number of connections). However, as link speeds and the number of flows increase, keeping per-flow state is either too expensive or too slow. We propose building compact summaries of the traffic data using the notion of sketches. We have designed a variant of the sketch data structure, k-ary sketch, which uses a constant, small amount of memory, and has constant per-record update and reconstruction cost. Its linearity property enables us to summarize traffic at various levels. We then implement a variety of time series forecast models (ARIMA, Holt-Winters, etc.) on top of such summaries and detect significant changes by looking for flows with large forecast errors. We also present heuristics for automatically configuring the model parameters.Using a large amount of real Internet traffic data from an operational tier-1 ISP, we demonstrate that our sketch-based change detection method is highly accurate, and can be implemented at low computation and memory costs. Our preliminary results are promising and hint at the possibility of using our method as a building block for network anomaly detection and traffic measurement."

However, giving computer agents a human-like body introduces new challenges. Since human users are very sensitive and critical concerning bodily behavior the agents must act naturally and individually in order to be believable. This dissertation focuses on conversational gestures. It shows how to generate conversational gestures for an animated embodied agent based on annotated text input. The central idea is to imitate the gestural behavior of a human individual. Using TV show recordings as empirical data, gestural key parameters are extracted for the generation of natural and individual gestures. The gesture generation task is solved in three stages: observation, modeling and generation. For each stage, a software module was developed. For observation, the video annotation research tool ANVIL was created. It allows the eAEcient transcription of gesture, speech and other modalities on multiple layers. ANVIL is application-independent by allowing users to de ne their own annotation schemes, it provides various import/export facilities and it is extensible via its plugin interface. Therefore, the tool is suitable for a wide variety of research elds. For this work, selected clips of the TV talk show \Das Literarische Quartett"" were transcribed and analyzed, arriving at a total of 1,056 gestures. For the modeling stage, the NOVALIS module was created to compute individual gesture pro les from these transcriptions with statistical methods. A gesture pro le models the aspects handedness, timing and function of gestures for a single human individual using estimated conditional probabilities. The pro les are based on a shared lexicon of 68 gestures, assembled from the data. Finally, for generation, the NOVA generator was devised to create gestures based on gesture pro les in an overgenerate-andlter approach. Annotated text input is processed in a graph-based representation in multiple stages where semantic data is added, the location of potential gestures is determined by heuristic rules, and gestures are added and ltered based on a gesture pro le. NOVA outputs a linear, player-independent action script in XML."

The objective of this research is to determine the most important factors influencing a drawing process, utilizing the help of a design of experiments and statistical analysis. The parameters varied include the punch and die radii, the punch velocity, clamping force, friction and draw depth. A deep drawing rig was designed and built for this purpose. Punches and dies of various geometries were manufactured. From previous FEA work and the experimental work performed to date, it seems that the punch/die radii have the greatest effect on the thickness of the deformed mild steel cups compared to blank-holder force or friction. The smaller is the punch/die radii, the greater is the punch force and shorter is the final draw. It has also been observed from the work to date that the speed of drawing plays an interesting role, in so far as, the higher is the speed the further is the draw, which is not entirely as expected. The cause of this will be further investigated. If the blank-holder force is not kept within the upper and lower limit of reasonable range it does have a significant effect on depth of draw, with the punch tearing through the bottom of the cup if the force is too high and if too low wrinkling of the flange area occurs. After observing the anisotropic effects of the rolling process on the sheet material through drawing it and seeing the extent of earing in the flange, some blanks were annealed for stress relief, then the draw depth was compared to that of the original mild steel blanks."

In our prior work, we proposed a method for hand-drawn sketch retrieval by performing stroke-by-stroke matching and by considering the spatial relationship between them. In this paper, we propose a method to simplify a sketch and perform matching in a hierarchical manner. With this approach, a shaded region or a region of complex strokes can be detected automatically and represented as a single hyper-stroke. In the matching stage, the similarity is computed by combining the similarity scores across the feature spaces at each level and the similarity of the stroke hierarchies. A sketch may be better represented by exploiting the structural relationship between the strokes. In addition, as a general rule to the hierarchical approach, it has the advantage of reduced computation thus the retrieval process would speed up."

This kind of architectural drawings consist of main walls represented by two parallel bold lines, symbols(door, window, tile...), dimension line, extension line, and dimensions represent various numerical values and characters. This paper suggests a method for recognizing main wall which is a back-bone of apartment in an architectural drawing. In this thesis, the following modules are realized: an efficient image binarization, a removal of thin lines, a vectorization of detected lines, a region bounding for main walls, a calculation of extension lines, a finding main walls based on extension line, and a field expansion by searching other main walls which are linked with the detected main walls. Although the windows between main walls are not represented as main walls, a detection module for the windows is considered during the recognition period. So the windows are found as a part of main wall. An experimental result on 9 different architectural drawings shows 96.5% recognition of main walls and windows, which is about 5.8% higher than that of Karl Tombre."

The processing is composed of the four functions: feature extraction of motifs, feature extraction of sketches, error identification, and generation and presentation of advice. We developed and experimented a prototype system limited to treat a basic motif and principal advice. As a result, the validity of the proposed system was confirmed."

The exaggeration of a caricature is accomplished by a prototype-based method that captures the artist's understanding of what are distinctive features of a face and the exaggeration style. Such prototypes are learnt by analyzing the correlation between the image caricature pairs using partial least-squares (PLS). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system."

Although the control skeleton is an effective tool, the manual construction of the skeleton can be a laborious process often requiring several hours of work and a fair degree of proficiency with the animation software used. 
The focus of the research described here is the automatic generation of such control skeletons. To this end, two solutions to the problem are presented, one general and one specific. In both cases, the input is required to be a set of polygonal data that defines the figure, and the output is a description of a control skeleton to be used in animating that figure. 
The general solution is widely applicable; it makes very few assumptions about the figure given as input or about the type of control skeleton that should be generated. A system is described that divides the problem into a series of steps, each of which is performed automatically. The basic process involves discretizing the figure, approximating its medial surface, and using that surface to construct a control skeleton. The system can produce a reasonably good control skeleton for any of a variety of figures in as little as one or two minutes on a low-end PC. 
The specific solution builds upon the general one but is geared toward producing more desirable skeletons for the very common case involving human-like and animal-like figures. Certain assumptions are made about the figure and about the type of control skeleton desired. In addition, heuristics based upon human and animal anatomy are invoked to adjust the control skeleton so that it is more anatomically appropriate. The motivation for this solution is the belief that a more anatomically appropriate control skeleton allows for more natural looking movement of a human or animal-like figure. 
Partly to support that claim, the system can produce geometry for individual bones that might function as the anatomical skeleton of the figure. This skeletal geometry can form the foundation for additional anatomical modeling that might add more realism to the animation of the figure."

In previous work we found that domain knowledge can aid recognition. Here we present an architecture to support the development of robust recognition systems across multiple domains.

It collects observations from our own recent research, which focused initially on the domain of sketched human stick figures in diverse postures, as well as related computer vision literature. Sketch recognition, i.e., labeling strokes in the input with the names of the model parts they depict, would be a key component of higher-level sketch understanding processes that reason about the recognized configurations. A sketch recognition technology must meet three main requirements. It must cope reliably with the pervasive variability of hand sketches, provide interactive performance, and be easily extensible to new configurations. We argue that useful sketch recognition may be within the grasp of current research, if these requirements are addressed systematically and in concert."

The analysis incorporates three-dimensional continuum elements for an elasto-plastic finite element method with the explicit time integration scheme using LS-DYNA3D. The analysis simulates the five-stage deep drawing and ironing process with the thickness control of the cup wall. Simulation is performed in order to investigate the failure by tearing during the forming process at the initial state of tool design. The analysis reveals that the difference of the drawing ratio within the cross section induces non-uniform metal flow which causes severe local extension. The irregular contact condition between the blank and the die also induces non-uniform metal flow which causes local wrinkling. This paper identifies such unfavorable mechanism in the rectangular cup drawing with ironing and proposes a new tool design with the guideline for modification in the design of the process and the sequential tool shape. The finite element analysis result with the improved tool design confirms that the proposed design not only reduces the possibility of failure but also improves the quality of a deep-drawn product. The numerical result shows fair coincidence with the experimental result.

To extract the shape information, a number of shape estimators are applied to each stroke to provide a soft decision about how similar it is to a particular shape type. Then, two strokes are matched according to a specific set of features for each shape type. The proximity of the corresponding strokes is used to account for the geometric relationship between multiple strokes during the matching stage. Our approach is robust to different drawing styles, thus making our retrieval system user-independent. Sketch retrieval is useful in applications where a user can easily search through a database of hand-draw sketches by inputting a sketch about what he/she is looking for, without the trouble of describing it using keywords."

Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: A general geriatric medical outpatient clinic in southwest Sydney, Australia. Participants: Ninety-three consecutive new patients to the clinic who had a non-English-speaking-background country of birth (mean age 78.0 years). Measurements: The clock drawing test was conducted at the beginning of each clinic visit by a blinded investigator. Each patient was then assessed by a geriatrician who collected demographic data, administered the Modified Barthel Index, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination, and categorized each patient as normal or demented, according to DSM-IV criteria. Interpreters were used for participants who spoke a language other than English or who requested them. Each clock drawing was scored according to the 4-point CERAD scale and the previously published methods of Mendez, Shulman, Sunderland, Watson, and Wolf-Klein. Scoring was evaluated for reliability and predictive accuracy, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the potential interaction between level of education and each of the clock scoring methods. Results: Using ROC curve analysis, there was no significant difference between the clock scoring methods (area under the curve varied from 0.60 to 0.72). The most sensitive was the Mendez scoring method (98%), with a specificity of 16%. Specificity above 50% was found only for the Wolf-Klein method, with an intermediate sensitivity of 78%. Conclusions: There were no significant differences in the clock scoring methods used to detect dementia. Performance of the clock drawing test was modest at best with low levels of specificity across all methods. Scored according to these methods, clock drawing was not a useful predictor of dementia in our multicultural population."

Interacting with software should — ideally — feel as natural, informal, rich, and easy as working with a human assistant. One key to this lies in enabling means of interacting with software that are similarly natural, informal, rich and easy. We are making it possible for people involved in design and planning tasks to sketch, gesture, and talk about their ideas (rather than type, point, and click), and have the computer system understand their messy freehand sketches, their casual gestures, and the fragmentary utterances that are part and parcel of such interaction. A second key lies in appropriate use each of the means of interaction. Our work to date has made it clear, for example, that different means are well suited to communicating different things: Geometry is best sketched, behavior and rationale are best described in words and gestures. A third key lies in the claim that interaction will be effortless only if the listener is smart: effortless interaction and invisible interfaces must be knowledge-based. If it is to make sense of informal sketches, the listener has to understand something about the domain and something about how freehand sketches are drawn. This paper provides an overview of six current pieces of work at the MIT AI Lab on the sketch recognition part of this overall goal."

Look over it, we can perceive the traces of parallel pencil strokes and a gray scale tone built with the strokes. If we look at any local area of the image, however, we can find that the direction of strokes and the intensity of pixels vary randomly. The variance of intensity results from the interaction of lead material and drawing paper. The LIC image shown in Figure 1(b), however, presents the very similar features. Since an LIC image is obtained by low-pass filtering a white noise along the streamlines of a vector field, we can see traces along streamlines. On the other hand, the intensities of pixels within any local area vary randomly as the input image is a white noise. Such similarity suggests us that we can imitate the tone of pencil drawings with an LIC image."

Sketch recognition applications built for the Oxygen platform include Ligature [4], Tahuti [6], and Assist [1] / Assistance [9]. To date, sketch recognition systems have been domain-specic, with the recognition details of the domain hard-coded into the system. A domain-independent recognition system is advantageous since it may be used for several domains, increasing the exibility and capabilities of a system. However, the system cannot identify the domain shapes if it doesn’t know that they are. In order to properly recognize a sketch of a particular domain, domain-specic information must be supplied to the domain-independent recognition system. Motivation: We propose a domain description language used to describe domain-specic information to a domain-independent sketch recognition system. The language is primarily based on shape to ensure correlation between the drawn shape and the recognized shapes. and to enable designers to draw the shapes as they would naturally. The language is different from other such languages because it can be also be to describe non-shape information, including display information, editing behavior, and drawing order. Previous Work: Shape description languages have been around for a long time [10]. These grammars have been studied widely within the eld or architecture, and many systems are still built using shape grammars [5]. However, they have been developed for design generation rather than recognition, and don’t provide for non-graphical information, such as stroke order, that may be helpful in recognition. Within the eld of sketch recognition, there have been other attempts to create shape languages for sketch recognition. [8] use a language to model and recognize stick gur es. The language currently is not hierarchical, making large objects cumbersome to describe. [3] use fuzzy relational grammars and [2] use BNF grammars to describe shape information. Both lack the ability to describe non-shape domain information such as stroke order or direction and editing behavior information. Approach: The difculties in determining the language’s components and syntax include ensuring that the language allows all common helpful domain information to be specied. The language must also encourage and facilitate the creation of correct programs. For instance, to encourage the reuse of geometric shape denitions, the language distinguishes between geometric shape denitions (shapes usable in many domains) and domain shapes (shapes specic to a domain). The language also provides abstract shape denitions that describe a class of similar shapes to prevent rewriting of identical attributes."

For the simulation a rigid-plastic finite element program has been used. The results of simulations are presented as the variation of drawing ratios with respect to various thickness ratios and setting conditions. They show that to achieve the highest drawing ratios in direct and reverse redrawing, the thickness ratio should be about 1 3 (one-layer aluminum and three-layer stainless-steel) and the setting conditions are opposite to each other. Considering the FEM results, laminated sheets with a thickness ratio of 71.3% aluminum and 28.7% stainless-steel were used to prepare deep drawing and redrawing experiments. The results of experiments are presented as the variation of thickness strain distribution in the drawn cup and punch load–stroke curves with respect to the setting condition. Results show that while in direct redrawing, contact of stainless-steel with the punch leads to the maximum drawing ratio, in reverse redrawing, aluminum should contact the punch in order to achieve the highest drawing ratio. An explanation for this finding is offered based on the thickness strain distribution, and punch load–stroke curves."

A direct numerical analysis of multi-stage deep-drawing processes is extremely difficult to carry out because of its complexities and convergence problems as well as tremendous computing time. The analysis of elliptical or rectangular cup drawing with large aspect ratio is likewise very difficult with respect to the design process parameters including the intermediate die profiles. In order to overcome the difficulties, an inverse scheme is proposed in the present analysis and design. The multi-stage inverse analysis deals with the convergence among intermediate shapes and the corresponding sliding constraint surfaces. In this paper, finite element inverse analysis is applied to multi-stage deep-drawing processes in order to calculate the thickness strain distribution in each intermediate shape and to design the intermediate die shapes. The original design has been modified to enhance the discrepancy in the thickness strain distribution for each intermediate shape."

An input sketchy (hand-drawn) shape is immediately converted into the user-intended rigid shape based on the shape similarity and the time constraint of the sketchy line. Three different (rule-based, SVM-based, and ANN-based) approaches have been applied and compared in the system. Experiments and evaluation are also presented, which show good performance of the system."

This variability corrupts the expected mapping between a prior model of a configuration and an instance of it in the scene. We propose a scheme for representing ambiguity explicitly, within a subgraph matching framework, that limits its impact on the computational and program complexity of matching. First, ambiguous alternative structures in the input are explicitly represented by coupled subgraphs of the data graph, using a class of segmentation post-processing operations termed graph elaboration. Second, the matching process enforces mutual exclusion constraints among these coupled alternatives, and preferences or rankings associated with them enable better matches to be found early on by a constrained optimization process. We describe several elaboration processes, and extend a straightforward constraint-based subgraph matching scheme to elaborated data graphs. The discussion focuses on the domain of human stick figures in diverse poses."

Proceedings (Cat. No.01CH37221)",2001,11,"This paper presents a technique for animating a three-dimensional face model through the application of principal component analysis (PCA). Using PCA has several advantages over traditional approaches to facial animation because it reduces the number of parameters needed to describe a face and confines the facial motion to a valid space to prevent unnatural contortions. First, real data is optically captured in real time from a human subject using infrared cameras and reflective trackers. This data is analyzed to find a mean face and a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues that are used to perturb the mean face within the range described by the captured data. The result is a set of vectors that can be linearly combined and interpolated to represent different facial expressions and animations. We also show that it is possible to map the eigenvectors of one face onto another face or to change the eigenvectors to describe new motion."

The model takes into account the large elastoplastic strains and rotations that occur in the deep-drawing process. Hill’s orthotropic yield criteria with isotropic and kinematics hardening describes the anisotropic plastic properties of the sheet. Coulomb’s classical law models the frictional contact problem treated with an augmented Lagrangian approach. This method yields a mixed system where the final unknowns of the problem are static (frictional contact forces) and kinematic (displacements) variables. To solve this problem use is made of a fully implicit algorithm of Newton–Raphson type. Three-dimensional isoparametric finite elements with a selective reduced integration are used for the spatial discretization of the deformed body. The geometry of the forming tools is modelled by Bezier surfaces. The numerical results of the deep-drawing of a square cup are presented to focus their good agreement with the results of experiment.

The algorithm is an extension of the Barnes-Hut hierarchical space decomposition method, which includes edges and multilevel visual abstraction. Compared to the original force directed algorithm, the time overhead is O(e + n log n) where n and e are the numbers of nodes and edges. The improvement is possible since the decomposition tree provides a systematic way to determine the degree of closeness between nodes without explicitly calculating the distance between each node. Different types of regular decomposition trees are introduced. The decomposition tree also represents a hierarchical clustering of the nodes, which improves in a graph theoretic sense as the graph drawing approaches a lower energy state. Finally, the decomposition tree provides a mechanism to view the hierarchical clustering on various levels of abstraction. Larger graphs can be represented more concisely, on a higher level of abstraction, with fewer graphics on screen."

Raw input strokes are continuously morphed into ideal geometric shapes, even before the pen is lifted. By means of smooth and continual shape transformations the user is apprised of recognition progress and the appearance of the final shape, yet always retains a sense of control over the process. At each time t the system uses the trajectory traced out thus far by the pen coupled with the current appearance of the time-varying shape to classify the sketch as one of several pre-defined basic shapes. The recognition operation is performed using shape-specific fits based on least-squares or relaxation, which are continuously updated as the user draws. We describe the time-dependent transformation of the sketch, beginning with the raw pen trajectory, using a family of first-order ordinary differential 
equations that depend on time and the current shape 
of the sketch. Using this formalism, we describe several possible behaviors that result by varying the relative significance of new and old portions of a stroke, changing the “viscosity” of the morph, and enforcing different end conditions. A preliminary user study suggests that the new interface is particularly effective for rapidly constructing diagrams consisting of simple shapes."

The algorithm has several steps. First, the figure is voxelized, and a Euclidean distance map is computed for voxels interior to the figure. A path creation algorithm then generates a tree-structured set of voxel paths spanning the object's interior. Simplification of these paths leads to a control skeleton for the object. The voxelization is used again to anchor the vertices of the polygonal model to the skeleton. Afterwards, new joint angles may be specified for the skeleton, and once the skeleton has been updated, vertices of the model can be repositioned accordingly. Unlike previous methods, the algorithm is fully automated, requiring very little user input. Also, it can be applied successfully to a wide variety of objects. Furthermore, the algorithm is fast-it can produce a useful control skeleton for most objects in under two minutes on a low-end PC."

The system is given a training set of many di erent lines, each drawn by an artist in various styles, which is used to translate new lines made by a user into a particular desired style with a K-nearest neighbor algorithm. This algorithm ts each input line as a linear combination of the several training lines in the same style which are most similar to it. The t line can then be rendered in di erent styles because the training set contains versions of each training line in each style. By describing input lines as linear combinations of training set lines, this procedure is expressive enough to t a broad range of input drawings. By restricting these linear combinations to contain only the most similar training set lines, this procedure is constrained enough to preserve the distinctive stylistic features of translated lines. We represent input lines by splines with nonuniformly spaced control points, which emphasizes these stylistic features. Our example-based approach has a number of advantages over conventional parameteric approaches to translating style. It can handle styles which are di cult to describe parametrically, and its repertoire can be easily extended by the user at any time. Moreover, given appropriate representations, it can be generalized to modify the style of other kinds of graphics objects, such as the font of a letter or the movement style of an animated character."

The translation-relevant elements of comics are then identified on the linguistic, typographic, and pictorial levels, and concepts of rhetoric are used to establish a classification of translation strategies which applies to both verbal and nonverbal textual material. Finally, a number of examples are discussed to highlight the diversity of translation strategies for the various elements of comics.Resume: En depit de leur frequence, les traductions des bandes dessinees (BD) sont souvent laissees pour compte par les traductologues.

Q J Exp Psychol 1991;43A:161-204) face recognition framework supports both a norm-based coding (NBC) and an exemplar-only, absolute coding, model (ABC). According to NBC; (1) faces are represented in terms of deviations from a prototype or norm; (2) caricatures are effective because they exaggerate this norm deviation information; and (3) other-race faces are coded relative to the (only available) own-race norm. Therefore NBC predicts that, for European subjects, caricatures of Chinese faces made by distorting differences from the European norm would be more effective than caricatures made relative to the Chinese norm. According to ABC; (1) faces are encoded as absolute values on a set of shared dimensions with the norm playing no role in recognition; (2) caricatures are effective because they minimise exemplar density and (3) the dimensions of face-space are inappropriate for other-race faces leaving them relatively densely clustered. ABC predicts that all faces would be recognised more accurately when caricatured against their own-race norm. We tested European subjects' identification of European and Chinese faces, caricatured against both race norms. The ABC model's prediction was supported. European faces were also rated as more distinctive and recognised more easily than Chinese faces. However, the own-race recognition bias held even when the races were equated for distinctiveness which suggests that the ABC model may not provide a complete account of race effects in recognition."

A procedure for rapid determination of LDR based on a characteristic limit load of the material at fracture is developed and verified. Other deep drawing characteristics such as punch load versus displacement traces, flange draw-in, strain distribution along the cup profile, flange wrinkling, wall ironing and fracture characteristics are experimentally assessed for the two sheet materials as a function of the die profile radius. The results are compared with a recent analytical model by Schedin (Ph.D. Thesis, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, 1991). as well as axisymmetric FE models of cup draw, to analyse the sensitivity of various material and test parameters towards the maximum punch load and stresses and strains in various regions of the cup. The deep drawability of AA5754-O, as measured by cup depth at fracture and LDR, is superior to that of AA6111-T4. The differences in the deep drawing behaviour of the two materials can be explained in terms of the competition in work hardening between the material in the flange at the die profile region versus the material at the punch profile region, bendability of the two materials, and fracture characteristics. A decrease in LDR and flange draw-in is observed as a function of the die profile radius. This decrease is attributed to the increased work hardening in the die profile region resulting from additional bending, unbending, and stretching of the material as it enters the die cavity, as well as increased tendency towards fracture for AA6111-T4."

Image Underst.,1997,8,The benefits of the existing CAD systems are not available to a large number of engineering drawings which were created manually on paper using conventional drafting methods. An automated system which will scan and convert these drawings into CAD files recognizable by the existing CAD systems is very desirable. An important element in the conversion process is the automatic recognition and understanding of dimensional information which is used to denote the exact size and location of the various entities present in the geometry described in the drawing. This paper discusses a system which has been developed to recognize the dimension sets from the vectorized image of the drawing and obtain the logical relationship between the dimension sets and the geometry. The recognized dimension sets are also integrated with the geometry of the object using a variational geometry approach to rectify the errors which are introduced during preprocessing. The drawing obtained after processing consists of an accurate vectorized representation of the geometry in terms of the basic geometric entities and a vectorized representation of the dimension sets which can be used in an dimension-driven CAD system.

It consists of three steps: growing individual characterbox regions, using a recursive merging scheme by stroke linking; merging the detected characterboxes into a textbox and determining its orientation; and re-segmenting the textbox back into the refined characterbox that can be input to an OCR subsystem. The method can segment dimensioning text as well as other classes of text. It handles both isolated and touching characters, aligned at any slant. The capability of segmenting characters that touch either themselves or graphics, which is an important feature in handling real life drawings, is obtained by focusing on intermediate vector information rather that on the raw pixel data. We present the details of the algorithm and show both successful and unsuccessful examples from an experimental set of 36 dimensioning textboxes, in which 94% segmentation rate was achieved with 3% false alarm rate."

For this purpose, the textures of three types of aluminum sheet (1145, a batch and a continuously annealed experimental alloy) were measured and analyzed using the series expansion method. The results indicate that the initial textures evolve towards the 〈111〉 and 〈100〉 type fiber textures after 20–30% of tensile deformation. After plane strain flange deformation during the early stages of deep drawing, the orientation densities increase around the P {011}〈111〉 and Goss {011}〈100〉 components. During the later stages of drawing, when flange thickening occurs, sometimes followed by ironing, the P orientation becomes unstable, whereas those along the α D -fiber are strengthened. The distinct texture changes taking place in each alloy are interpreted in terms of differences in the strengths and distributions of the initial texture components. The earing behaviors of the three materials are also analyzed in terms of the initial strengths of the cube {001}〈100〉, Goss {011}〈100〉 and R {113}〈574〉 components."

First, we calculate curve points by applying non-maximal suppress on secondary derivative of cartoon images. Second, these curve points are linked together to form structure curves while unreliable curves are removed away. Compared to curve structure extraction algorithm proposed by Steger, the number of curves generated by our algorithm is only 19% of Steger’s on average, with better curve quality. Furthermore, more accurate curve position can be obtained by our method."

Intell.,1995,61,"Arcs are important primitives in engineering drawings. Extracting these primitives during the lexical analysis phase is a prerequisite to syntactic and semantic understanding of engineering drawings within the machine drawing understanding system. Bars are detected by the orthogonal zig-zag vectorization algorithm. Some of the detected bars are linear approximations of arcs. As such, they provide the basis for arc segmentation. An arc is detected by finding a chain of bars and a triplet of points along the chain. The arc center is first approximated as the center of mass of the triangle formed by the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the chords these points define. The location of the center is refined by recursively finding more such triplets and converging to within no more than a few pixels from the actual arc center after two or three iterations. The high performance of the algorithm, demonstrated on a set of real engineering drawings, is due to the fact that it avoids both raster-to-vector and massive pixel-level operations, as well as any space transformations. >"

Lett.,1995,17,"Abstract Pattern recognition involves a host of problems, algorithms and techniques dealing with all aspects of detection and classification of objects in scenes and their conversion into meaningful interpretations. Frequently, such tasks are embedded within vision systems that are themselves embedded within more complex systems. Concentrating on minute, albeit important, details of some pattern recognition algorithm, may result in blurring of the “big picture” that puts the algorithm under consideration in the more general framework. Pattern recognition (PR)-embedded systems feature a combination of complexity on the one hand and a balance between structure and behavior on the other hand. Analysis and understanding of such systems call therefore for a methodology that represents equally well structure and behavior within a unified frame of reference and has adequate tools for complexity management. This work proposes the object-process analysis (OPA) as an approach to tackle this task. The Machine Drawing Understanding System (MDUS) is as an instance of a PR-embedded system used as a case in point. We provide a motivation for the development of the system in general and its specialized Orthogonal Zig-Zag (OZZ) vectorization algorithm in particular. To demonstrate the suitability of OPA for representing PR-embedded systems at any level of detail, we apply it to communicate a top-down introduction of MDUS and its OZZ algorithm. The result is a series of consistent, inter-related object-process diagrams that gradually expose the details of the system. Complexity is managed through visibility control, which is obtained by a host of options for scaling object process diagrams. The ease of application of object-process analysis to the case in point suggests that it can be successfully applied to analyze, understand and communicate PR-embedded systems."

The teacher examples are stored along with the corresponding environmental parameters so that future modification/expansion becomes much more easier. Since most of the attribute values are continuous-valued so that the construction of decision tree is more time consuming, we propose can improved algorithm for more efficient selection of cut points. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm for cut point selection in decision tree generation improves the efficiency by up to 6 times while ensuring the optimal result."

Images can be ranked according to the matching of their objects with the sketch, and the top ranking ones can be presented to the user for browsing.

First order logic, the logic and semantics of programming languages, and the languages that have been formulated for various kinds of categories are all commonly described in this way. The formulas in those logics are strings of symbols that are ultimately modeled on the sentences mathematicians speak and write when proving theorems. 
Mathematicians with a categorial orientation frequently state and prove theorems using graphs and diagrams. The theory of sketches provides a formal way to describe mathematical structures and impose requirements (such as equations) on them using graphs, diagrams and similar structures. The graphs, diagrams and other data of a sketch are formal objects that correspond to the graphs and diagrams used by such mathematicians in much the same way as the formulas of traditional logic correspond to the sentences mathematicians use in proofs. 
Sketch theory has a well-known and well-developed functorial semantics corresponding to item 3 in the description of logic above. The content of this paper is to propose a structure in sketch theory that corresponds to items 1 and 2 in that description."

This may occur because faces are encoded as distinctive feature deviations from a prototype. The exaggeration of these deviations in a caricature may enhance recognition because it emphasizes the features of the face that are encoded. In two experiments, we tested the superportrait hypothesis and the encoding-by-caricature hypothesis. In the first experiment, caricatures were recognized better than faces, and true caricatures of previously seen faces were recognized better than the faces from which the caricatures had been developed. In the second experiment, faces and their caricatures were tachistoscopically presented in a sequential same/different reaction time task. Subjects were slower to distinguish the stimuli when the face preceded its caricature, indicating that caricatures are more similar to the encoded representation of a face than are stimuli in which the distinctive features are deemphasized."

In this way, well-known algorithms from graph theory can be used. The graph is searched for characteristic sub-graphs, revealing the presence of symbols or noisy objects overlapping lines.

Following procedures of Brennan 7,8 the 2D Cartesian coordinates of each feature point are compared with those of an average for many faces; differences in positions are exaggerated (to produce caricature data sets) or reduced (giving ‘anticaricature’ data sets). Line-drawing representations of faces and their caricatures are formed by linking appropriate feature points. To produce continuous-tone caricatures, the original and caricature images are resolved into (340) adjacent triangular tessellations. Rendering of the final image is accomplished by mapping the pixel values (grey-scale or colour) from each source triangle in the original image to the corresponding triangle in the caricature image.

The present work exhibits the fact that the final geometry of the product (mainly the wall thickness variations) depends on the overall history by which the fluid pressure-path is operated during the drawing process. In addition, other phenomena akin to hydroforming processes have been observed, e.g. the shift in the location of the rupture site (if it occurs) from near the bottom of the product to near its lip and the (slight) variation in the final length of the product. In order to explain these occurrences a detailed numerical stress analysis is offered, featured by an ad-hoc “finite difference” scheme. It differs from previous solutions by admitting changes in the thickness of the blank and still accounting for the blank/tool interfacial friction and the out-of-plane curvature of the product. The material behavior of the blank includes exponential strain hardening, normal anisotropy and initial strain. The experiments shown here were carried out on aluminum sheets with a specially built hydroforming machine."

Drawing data, sampled at a high and constant rate, is compressed and mapped into lines and splines, in two and three dimensions. This is achieved by inferring a particular user's intentions from measures of speed and pressure.Recent experiments have shown that even the most basic inference making cannot rely solely upon knowledge of the user's drawing style, but needs additional knowledge of the subject being drawn, the protocols of its domain, and the stage of development of the user's design. This requirement implies a higher level of machine intelligence than currently exists. An alternate approach is to increase the user's involvement in the recognition process.Contrary to previous efforts to move from sketch to mechanical drawing without human intervention, this paper reports on an interactive system for graphical input in which the user overtly partakes in training the machine and massaging the data at all levels of interpretation. The initial routines for data compression employ parallel functions for extracting such features as bentness, straightness, and endness. These are planned for implementation in microprocessors.Results offer a system for rapid (and enjoyable) graphical input with real-time interpretation, the beginnings of an intelligent tablet."

Christopher F. Herot,3cd9b131b86f4953f23a901004c18ad7b9536aed,Using context in sketch recognition.,,1974,3,"A central problem in graphical communication between a human and a computer is the ability of the computer to build an internal representation of the human designer's intentions, something which is not possible if the machine does not have some knowledge of the subject matter being sketched. This thesis describes a system for storing such knowledge in the computer, to be used by the machine in building a model of the user's intentions. This semantic knowledge is stored in a network and matched to the input sketch in a top-down manner, using the knowledge to direct the machine's search for entities in the sketch. The operation of a simple program using these principles is presented in detail along with an account of the complexities involved in applying the scheme to complex sketches. Methods of representing relationships to be looked for in a drawing are described and examples are provided of some descriptions which should prove useful in the next implementation. Two implementatons are described, one on a mini-computer and one on a large time sharing system. Included is a discussion of the requirements such a program makes on the programming environment and their implications for the future of inexpensive mini-computer oriented implementations.

N. Negroponte,f294b3912f7cb13ff6181128198c31226d80d05b,Recent advances in sketch recognition,AFIPS National Computer Conference,1973,43,"In a shocking and almost silly interview with Max Jacobson, Christopher Alexander recounted the following story.
 ""There was a conference which I was invited to a few months ago where computer graphics was being discussed as one item and I was arguing very strongly against computer graphics simply because of the frame of mind that you need to be in to create a good building. Are you at peace with yourself? Are you thinking about smell and touch, and what happens when people are walking about in a place? But particularly, are you at peace with yourself? All of that is completely disturbed by the pretentiousness, insistence and complicatedness of computer graphics and all the allied techniques. So my final objection to that and to other types of methodology is that they actually prevent you from being in the right state of mind to do the design, quite apart from the question of whether they help in a sort of technical sense, which, as I said, I don't think they do."""
F. Parke,63f24b857fad276c13bfe763401ec72f343de167,Computer generated animation of faces,ACM Annual Conference,1972,425,"This paper describes the representation, animation and data collection techniques that have been used to produce ""realistic"" computer generated half-tone animated sequences of a human face changing expression. It was determined that approximating the surface of a face with a polygonal skin containing approximately 250 polygons defined by about 400 vertices is sufficient to achieve a realistic face. Animation was accomplished using a cosine interpolation scheme to fill in the intermediate frames between expressions. This approach is good enough to produce realistic facial motion. The three-dimensional data used to describe the expressions of the face was obtained photogrammetrically using pairs of photographs."
"N. Burtnyk, M. Wein",48537c35744ad8595c35cdf5514c27b7264d4eec,Computer-Generated Key-Frame Animation,,1971,130,"Special animation languages have been developed for specifying an image sequence to be generated by a computer. Although this approach to computer animation has provided some form of organization and control of the specification of image sequences, the computer remains out of reach to most animators because of the communication difficulty. An animator's ideas involve mainly pictures and their motion. Thus it is appropriate that the communication of ideas between the animator and the computer should be largely through pictures. An interactive computer-controlled graphical system allows the animator to develop pictorial sequences directly on a cathode-ray tube display, without forcing the animator to become a computer programer. The implementation of computer-generated key-frame animation is based on techniques that have been developed for conventional cel animation. Key frames are created and stored on a suitable medium such as digital magnetic tape or disc. In addition to the picture, information about the kind of motion and the number of frames from the previous key frame is specified. During playback of this sequence, the in-between frames are computed by interpolating between key frames and are displayed at the cine rate on the cathode-ray display. Thus previewing is available in seconds."
